Saving Babies’ Lives Starts With Aquarium Pumps And Ingenuity	2014-01-03	2014	1	Good ideas don’t only come from experts. An innovative engineering program in Texas has been proving that college undergraduates can tackle  —   and solve  —   vexing health challenges in developing countries. Two engineers at Rice University in Houston are tapping the potential of bright young minds to change the world. Big Problems, Simple Solutions, Rural hospitals in the developing world have lots of problems. Some are huge: lack of electricity, lack of staff, lack of supplies. But some problems are much smaller, and can be overcome with a bit of ingenuity. ”We want to teach our students that they can solve these problems,” says Rice engineering professor Maria Oden. Oden runs a program called Rice 360, designed to get students to first learn about the problems of rural hospitals and then find solutions. Oden’s partner in this project, Rebecca   is the chairwoman of bioengineering at Rice. ”These are not going to be MRI machines or CT machines,” she says. ”These are going to be simple technologies that you could develop in the course of a semester or in the course of a year.” Maybe a simple system to measure drug dosage, or a way to deliver the right amount of IV fluids. The students have to build a prototype, but Oden says some of these students will take their invention even further. ”Go into the field, test it, get feedback, return to Rice, redesign,” she says. ”Most of the time the first design doesn’t work very well, and so they redesign it until they get to a point where it’s a product that can be deployed. That’s the ultimate goal, for sure.” Oden says once a team of undergraduates sinks its teeth into a project, it’s hard to let go. ”We have teams who may have been in a class four semesters ago, and they are still working on this project  —   not because they are getting credit, not because they are in a course, but because they want to solve this problem,” she says. A Shoebox And An Aquarium Pump, One of the most successful projects has been something called a bubble CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure). It helps premature infants breathe by pushing a steam of air into their lungs.   says a team of Rice students found some clever ways to make a bubble CPAP that was affordable. ”One of the wonderful things about working with    is that they’re so creative,” she says. ”They don’t have fixed ideas about what might not work. And so you get really crazy ideas. Like inside our bubble CPAP machine, there’s aquarium pumps.” Aquarium pumps? Well, why not? They’re cheap, and they worked. The prototype for the CPAP device was made with a plastic shoe box from Target and two fish tank pumps to get enough flow. Oden says they’ve tested their bubble CPAP in rural hospitals in Malawi, and now they’re starting to deploy them at hospitals around that country. The device has been   to look more professional, but it’s basically the same as the original design, aquarium pumps and all.   Difference,   says it’s a long slog to go from design to product to actually seeing something work, but it’s worth it. ”It’s sort of magic when you see it come together. It’s the best part of our job,” she says.   and Oden went to Malawi a while back with one of the students who had worked on the bubble CPAP design project. They visited one of the rural hospitals where they’d tested the device. A nurse told them they had used the CPAP on her own baby, and it saved his life. ”She was able to go get her baby, so that we could meet the baby, and the student was able to look and see a life that she had affected,”   says. ”It sent chills all the way down my entire spine, because I realized that while we’re teaching students, and we want them to leave here believing they can make a difference, this was the picture of a true difference being made.” Oden and   are hoping that once students learn how wonderful it feels to make a difference in the world, they’ll be hooked  —   and at least some of those students will devote their professional lives to doing that.
Voting Rights Act Fast Facts	2014-01-07	2014	1	 (CNN) Here is a look at the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which serves to protect and enforce the 14th and 15th Amendments. It was enacted in response to voter suppression in the 1960s by state and local governments and law enforcement.  Important sections:Original jurisdictions: Alabama, Alaska, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina and Virginia. Also, subdivisions, mostly counties, in Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho and North Carolina. Jurisdictions are made based on a formula containing two elements: If less than 50% of the voting age population is registered to vote by November 1, 1964, or if less that 50% voted in the 1964 presidential election. It also guarantees the right to register and vote to citizens with ”limited English proficiency.” Section 2: States the right to vote cannot be denied on the basis of race or color. Section 3: Upholds the ability to enforce the 15th Amendment. Section 4:  Says citizen cannot be denied the right to vote for failed compliance with devices such as literacy tests. It also designates the formulated jurisdictions outlined in Section 5. The requirement for preclearance of voting changes was ruled unconstitutional in a 2013 U. S. Supreme Court decision. ”The effect of the Shelby County decision is that the jurisdictions identified by the coverage formula in Section 4( b) no longer need to seek preclearance for the new voting changes, unless they are covered by a separate court order entered under Section 3( c) of the Voting Rights Act.” Section 5: This section ”freezes (new) election practices or procedures in certain states until the new procedures have been subjected to review.” Review can only be done by the U. S. Attorney General or by filing a lawsuit before the U. S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Yet Section 5 is basically unenforceable as there is no longer a preclearance requirement in Section 4. Timeline:March 7, 1965   Bloody Sunday   About 600   voting rights marchers heading to Montgomery, Alabama’s state capital, are attacked by state troopers in Selma. March 15, 1965   President Lyndon Johnson, in a speech before a joint session of Congress says: ”There is no constitutional issue here. The command of the Constitution is plain. There is no moral issue. It is wrong, deadly wrong, to deny any of your fellow Americans the right to vote in this country.” August 6, 1965   Is signed into law by President Johnson to protect and enforce the 15th Amendment. 1970   Congress extends provisions for five years, changing the formula in Section 4 to reflect 1968 (instead of 1964). Coverage is added in jurisdictions within 10 more states: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Idaho, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York and Wyoming. Connecticut, Idaho, Maine, Massachusetts and Wyoming win ”bailout” lawsuits. 1975   Congress extends provisions for seven years, changes the formula to 1972 and broadens the discrimination description as also encompassing American Indians, Asian Americans, Alaskan Natives or people of Spanish heritage. This addition to the formula essentially covers Alaska, Arizona and Texas, and includes parts of California, Florida, Michigan, New York, North Carolina and South Dakota. 1982   Congress extends the special provisions in Section 4 for 25 years, but makes no changes.  2006   Congress renews special provisions and extends the act until 2031.  June 25, 2013   The U. S. Supreme Court decides ( ) that formulated jurisdictions under Section 5 no longer have to have new voting laws   by the attorney general or the federal district court in the District of Columbia. Chief Justice John Roberts explains that ”our country has changed” and the formula ”no longer characterize( s) voting in the covered jurisdictions.” March 7, 2015   President Barack Obama signs legislation awarding the Congressional Gold Medal ”to the Foot Soldiers who participated in the Bloody Sunday, Turnaround Tuesday, or the final Selma to Montgomery Voting Rights March in March of 1965, which served as a catalyst for the Voting Rights Act.”

Blood Pressure Ruckus Reveals Big Secret In Medicine	2014-01-15	2014	1	There has been a carefully guarded secret in medicine: Evidence is often inconclusive, and experts commonly disagree about what it means. Most medical decisions aren’t cut and dried. Instead they’re usually made with uncertainty about what is best for each person. This uncertainty secret has been revealed in a very public disagreement among experts about who should be treated for high blood pressure. The controversy hinges on the level of blood pressure that should serve as a trigger for treatment. The new guidelines says that people 60 years and older can seek a systolic blood pressure goal (the top number) of 150 or less. The old guidelines says that 140 or less should be the goal. But now some experts who were part of the group responsible for the new advice seem to have changed their minds. They’re publicly splitting from the new guidelines that still bear their names and saying the old, lower treatment goal is the one to follow. With more than 30 million Americans with high blood pressure and billions of dollars spent on drugs to treat it, this issue has substantial implications for many patients and financial consequences for the drug industry. I have heard from patients who feel uneasy about being in the middle of this dispute. There are people who are on three medications and wondering if, based on the new recommendations, they should change their regimen and decrease the number of drugs. These people needed multiple medications to get their blood pressure below 140, and now the new guidelines question whether that number of drugs was necessary. There are others who would have been started on drug treatment under the old recommendations, but would be   under the new ones. People with the same blood pressure might choose different approaches  —   and they can both be right  —   because the scientific evidence can only take them so far. Many people wonder how doctors could disagree on a recommendation that has such   impact. To be clear, there is strong evidence and little disagreement in many areas related to the treatment of high blood pressure. For example, there is strong agreement that it is preferable to use lifestyle interventions rather than medications. Diet and exercise should always be the first option. And there is also agreement about the large benefit for patients from the treatment of very high blood pressure. But what is notable right now is that a fundamental recommendation about what should be the goal of therapy is no longer considered to be a treatment tenet that can’t be violated. There is open disagreement about it. This dispute signals clearly that there are options for patients. The lack of consensus in the medical establishment is a good opportunity for personalization according to patient preference (which, by the way, I think should always be the approach). If you don’t like taking medications and want strong evidence of benefit to justify drugs before you start, then you may favor the more permissive target level. If you don’t mind drugs and want a lower blood pressure even though the evidence of benefit is unclear to some experts, then you would want to go with the lower goal. Both options are reasonable. Although it’s uncomfortable to be made aware of disagreements in medicine, patients should know that differences of opinion in medicine are common. What is rare is to have these differences explicitly acknowledged. One potential benefit from this dispute would be the start of a public dialogue about making   medical decisions amid uncertainty. In any case, we doctors need to learn to be comfortable with uncertainty, disclose it and help people make decisions in spite of it. The most important message for doctors is that these everyday situations call for us to be sure we’re allowing the preferences of patients to lead. Letting the secret out about our uncertainty may actually lead to better choices for patients. Krumholz is a cardiologist and the Harold H. Hines Jr. Professor of Medicine at Yale University School of Medicine.

The greatest MLK speeches you never heard	2014-01-19	2014	1	 (CNN) Here’s a pop quiz for anyone who calls the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. an American hero. Can you name any of his great speeches or written works without citing ”I Have a Dream” or the ”Letter from Birmingham Jail”? Most Americans would likely flub this quiz. King may be a national hero whose birthday the country commemorates on Monday, but to many he remains a   hero    the vast body of his work unknown. Though he wrote five books and delivered up to 450 speeches a year, he’s defined by one speech and one letter. What then are the great works by King that never get the attention they deserve?  That’s the question CNN put to some members of King’s inner circle as well as top King scholars. We asked them to pick their favorite overlooked gems from King, any extraordinary spoken or written words people don’t typically hear during King commemorations.  Six entries made our final cut:  three sermons and speeches, King’s most radical book, an astonishing letter he wrote as a college student, and a ”eulogy” he delivered for a friend that revealed a side of him the public rarely saw. ’A Time to Break the Silence’  Sermon delivered at Riverside Church in New York on April 4, 1967. Why it’s important: This was King’s most controversial speech. Even some members of his own staff warned him not to give it. With this sermon, King decisively came out against the Vietnam War at a time when many Americans still supported it. People were furious. President Lyndon Johnson stopped talking to him. Civil rights leaders criticized him, and major newspapers told him to stick to civil rights. Yet King put principle over personal popularity and continued to oppose the war. One year later to the day he gave this speech, King was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee. What he said: Money that should have been spent on Johnson’s War on Poverty was being lost in Vietnam’s killing fields. He said, ”A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death.” The speech distilled King’s belief that racism, economic exploitation and war were all connected as ”triple evils.”  Signature lines:  ”We are taking the black young men who had been crippled by our society and sending them 8, 000 miles away to guarantee liberties in Southeast Asia which they had not found in Southwest Georgia and East Harlem. So we have been repeatedly faced with the cruel irony of watching Negro and white boys on TV screens as they kill and die together for a nation that has been unable to seat them together in the same schools.” What others say: ”It’s Dr. King’s most underappreciated speech,” says Vorris Nunley, a professor of rhetoric at the University of California, Riverside. ”Former supporters, black as well as white, backed away from this too compassionate, too radical, too political King.” Rare recording of MLK Jr. talking about JFK released, ’Our God is Marching On!’ Speech delivered on March 25, 1965, in Montgomery, Alabama, at the end of the    march. Why it’s important: It is one of King’s most electrifying speeches. When the roaring crowd joins King in shouting ”Glory hallelujah!” at the end of the speech, the march becomes a church revival. The speech was the culmination of one of the movement’s most brutal but critical campaigns. Three civil rights activists were killed and other marchers were beaten at the Edmund Pettus Bridge.  King gave his defiant speech while standing on the steps of the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery, a city known as the ”Cradle of the Confederacy.” This was the   mark of the civil rights movement. The Selma campaign would spark the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. What he said: King praised the white clergy and laypeople of various faiths who traveled to Selma to face danger with   protesters. He said that segregation was ”on its deathbed” and the movement must now be prepared to ”march on poverty.”  Signature lines: ”They told us we wouldn’t get here. And there were those who said that we would get here only over their dead bodies, but all the world today knows that we are here and that we are standing before the forces of power in the state of Alabama saying, ’We ain’t going to let nobody turn us around.’ ”I come to say to you this afternoon, however difficult the moment, however frustrating the hour, it will not be long, because ’truth crushed to earth will rise again.’ How long? Not long, because ’no lie can live forever.’ . .. How long? Not long, because the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.” What others say: The speech marked the triumphant end of the first phase of the civil rights movement    seeking legal and political rights    and the beginning of a new phase focused on economic inequality, says Jerald Podair, a history professor at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin.  ”We see King at a moment of triumph,” Podair says. ”He is on the steps of the Alabama State Capitol, near the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church from which he launched the Montgomery bus boycott, as (Alabama) Gov. George Wallace cowers in his office with blinds drawn. But he also has miles to go. America is still an economically and socially divided nation.  Opinion: On MLK day, helping the unemployed is a moral issue, ’The American Dream’ Sermon delivered at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta on July 4, 1965. Why it’s important: We’ve heard about King’s dream. But just two years later he told an audience that his dream had turned into a nightmare. King’s sermon addresses questions that could have been snatched from today’s headlines: What is a living wage for workers in menial jobs? Is income inequality as corrosive as racial injustice? What are the challenges of preserving a multicultural democracy?  What he said:  King said that class divisions within the United States ”can be as vicious and evil as a system based on racial injustice.” King also talked about the dignity of all work, saying that even menial workers should make enough ”so they can live and educate their children and buy a home and have the basic necessities of life.” Signature lines:  ”About two years ago now, I stood with many of you who stood there in person and all of you who were there in spirit before the Lincoln Memorial in Washington. As I came to the end of my speech there, I tried to tell the nation about a dream I had. I must confess to you this morning that since that sweltering August afternoon in 1963, my dream has often turned into a nightmare.  ”I’ve seen my dream shattered as I’ve walked the streets of Chicago and see Negroes, young men and women, with a sense of utter hopelessness because they can’t find any jobs. . .. I’ve seen my dream shattered as I’ve been through Appalachia, and I’ve seen my white brothers along with Negroes living in poverty. And I’m concerned about white poverty as much as I’m concerned about Negro poverty.”  What others say: ”The dream is now clearly tied to equal job opportunities and decent wages,” says Thomas Jackson, author of ”From Civil Rights to Human Rights: Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Struggle for Economic Justice.”  ”King asks: How are you going to have a multiracial democracy if inequality makes life is so harsh and competitive at the bottom, where society is most multiracial and multinational?” 9 thinks about MLK’s ’Dream’ speech and the March on Washington, ’Mock eulogy’ Delivered just before the 1963 campaign in Birmingham, Alabama.  Why it’s important: ”Every hero becomes a bore at last.” That quote from the 19th century writer Ralph Waldo Emerson could have applied to King. With the rise of the Black Power movement, King seemed dull and obsolete to many youths in the late 1960s who preferred the fire of Malcolm X and the Black Panthers. King dressed like an undertaker and carefully measured each word in public. But King’s ”mock eulogy” reveals that in private King had a wicked sense of humor. He was a man who nicknamed one of his top aides, ”Lil’ Nigger,” drank Harveys Bristol Cream sherry and smoked in private, and liked ”playing the dozens,” an   tradition of friends   trading insults. What he said: The moment is grim. King is holding a meeting of top staffers in 1963 just before they initiate a campaign in Birmingham. He warns them that some may not return alive. Then he breaks the tension by assuring them he would preach a marvelous tribute for anyone who doesn’t make it. He proceeds by delivering an    eulogy for one of his aides at the meeting, Andrew Young, who was often dispatched to negotiate with white leaders because of his nonthreatening demeanor.  Signature lines: ”Andy, when the Klan finally gets you, here’s what I’ll preach: ’Lord, white folks made a big mistake today. They have sent home to glory your faithful servant, Andrew Young. Lord, have mercy on the white folks who did this terrible deed. They killed the wrong Negro. In Andrew Young, white folk had a friend so faithful, so enduring, they should never have harmed a hair on his head. Of all my associates, no one loved white folks as much as Andy.’ ”  What others say:  ”King lived under the tremendous burden of people’s expectations,” says Jonathan Rieder, a sociology professor at Barnard College in New York who includes King’s mock eulogy and other examples of his ”backstage” personality in his book, ”The Word of the Lord is Upon Me: The Righteous Performance of Martin Luther King, Jr.”  ”By temperament, he had a tremendous sense of refinement and dignity,” Rieder says. ”The burden of dignity was always being proper because he was leading people. So this was a special moment with his preacher buddies when he could cut loose and renew his spirit to go on.” Would the government have spied on MLK Jr. today? Letter to Coretta, Written on July 18, 1952, to his future wife, Coretta Scott, in which King revealed some surprising thoughts on capitalism and communism.  Why it’s important: There’s a theory that King adopted more radical economic theories in the last three years of his life. But King’s 1952 letter reveals he was radical far earlier than most people realize.   What he said: The letter is an intriguing mix of the personal and abstract. King woos his future wife by telling her: ”My life without you is like a year without a springtime which comes to give illumination and heat to the atmosphere which has been saturated by the dark cold breeze of winter.”   He then switches gears and starts praising a recent book on economics he has read. He says he would ”certainly welcome the day to come when there will be a nationalization of industry . .. and a better distribution of wealth.”  Signature lines: ”I imagine you already know that I am much more socialistic in my economic theory than capitalistic. And yet I am not so opposed to capitalism that I have failed to see its relative merits. It started out with a noble and high motive, to block the trade monopolies of nobles, but like most human systems it falls victim to the very thing it was revolting against. So today capitalism has outlived its usefulness. It has brought about a system that takes necessities from the masses to give luxuries to the classes.” What others say: ”King steered toward socialism early on,” says Michael G. Long, author of ”Christian Peace and Nonviolence: A Documentary History.”  ”He’s speaking about the need for the demise of capitalism, the need to nationalize industries. Early on he has this dream that equality won’t happen in America until there’s a radical redistribution of wealth.”  Opinion: How MLK ad helped define America’s press freedoms, ’Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community’ King’s fifth book was published in 1967, Why it’s important: This is King’s last    and most radical    book. By 1967, he was organizing a ”Poor People’s Campaign,” a plan to dispatch an interracial army of poor people to occupy Washington and force the U. S. government to address poverty. What he said: He takes on black nationalists who ridiculed nonviolence. He says the passage of civil rights laws is not enough. The country must institute a ”massive, new national program” to attack poverty. He predicts the civil rights movement will go international as oppressed peoples in other countries adopt nonviolent tactics to combat America’s ”economic colonialism.”    Signature lines: ”White Americans must recognize that justice for black people cannot be achieved without radical changes in the structure of our society. The comfortable, entrenched, the privileged cannot continue to tremble at the prospect of change of the status quo. . .. This is a multiracial nation where all groups are dependent on each other. . .. There is no separate white path to power and fulfillment, short of social disaster, that does not share power with black aspirations for freedom and human dignity.” What others say: ”I get so tired of people turning Dr. King into a dreamer,” says Doreen Loury, a sociology professor at Arcadia University in Pennsylvania, who says she was blown away by the book when she first read it in the 1960s. ”They made him safe. He was a revolutionary.” Oliver Stone drops out of MLK Jr. project
Is marijuana as safe as -- or safer than -- alcohol?	2014-01-20	2014	1	 (CNN) As more states legalize medical and even recreational marijuana, more communities are being forced to ask a key question about pot: how bad is it, really? Even the President has weighed in: Watch the CNN Original Series ”High Profits” Sunday nights at 10 p. m.   on CNN. Read this article in Spanish, ”As has been   I smoked pot as a kid, and I view it as a bad habit and a vice, not very different from the cigarettes that I smoked as a young person up through a big chunk of my adult life,” President Barack Obama told New Yorker Editor David Remnick. ”I don’t think it is more dangerous than alcohol.”  Alcohol is the most commonly used addictive substance in the United States, according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. It’s legal for those 21 and older. Only about 22% of adult women and 11% of adult men are lifetime alcohol abstainers. Marijuana, on the other hand, is classified by the Drug Enforcement Agency as a Schedule 1 substance    the same category as heroin, LSD and Ecstasy    and is illegal in almost all states for recreational use. As such, comprehensive data on the drug’s use and misuse in the United States is limited.  Here’s what we do know:  Addiction, Alcohol’s addictive qualities are  . Approximately 17. 6 million people, or one in every 12 adults, suffer from alcohol abuse or dependence, according to the NIAAA. Alcoholics in withdrawal can suffer from anxiety and depression, headaches, insomnia, nausea, fever and even seizures. The addictive qualities of marijuana are not yet fully understood. The National Institute on Drug Abuse estimates 9% of people who use marijuana will become addicted to it. For comparison’s sake, cocaine hooks about 20% of those who use it.  ”There is clear evidence that in some people, marijuana use can lead to withdrawal symptoms, including insomnia, anxiety and nausea,” CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta wrote in his story, ”Why I changed my mind on weed,” referring to medical marijuana.  ”Even considering this, it is hard to make a case that it has a high potential for abuse. The physical symptoms of marijuana addiction are nothing like those of the other drugs I’ve mentioned.” Driving under the influence, Every hour, one person is killed and 20 are injured in crashes involving a drunken driver, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.  A recent study found that even slightly ”buzzed” drivers    drivers with a blood alcohol level of 0. 01% meaning someone who has had even one drink    are 46% more likely to be blamed for a crash when they collide with a sober driver.  The jury is still out on the impact of people who use marijuana and drive. Early studies showed marijuana had a slight impact on the psychomotor skills needed to drive, but these studies were seen as limited since they were done in lab situations.  A recent study review published in the British Medical Journal found people who used marijuana within three hours of driving were nearly twice as likely to cause a crash as sober drivers. People who use marijuana in combination with other drugs or alcohol also pose an increased crash risk, research suggests.   Munchies and beer bellies  It seems logical to think that alcohol would make you gain weight. One shot of liquor has about 100 calories a beer usually contains around 150. Plus, alcohol lowers your inhibitions, encouraging you to binge on pizza and nachos.  As for marijuana, even cops know it gives you the munchies.  Yet some studies on whether alcohol or marijuana really cause weight gain have been contradictory. One study of more than 19, 000 women showed those who drank alcohol in moderation actually weighed less than those who didn’t over 12 years. Others have linked obesity and alcoholism frequent drinkers seem to be more at risk.  Marijuana smokers seem to be skinnier than those who don’t smoke. A study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology found that rates of obesity are lower by roughly a third in people who smoke pot at least three times a week, compared with those who don’t use marijuana at all.   Talking to kids about legal marijuana, The desire’s there. .. Drinking reduces your inhibitions and can certainly make you feel more relaxed in social situations. But those lower inhibitions can also lead you to engage in risky sexual behavior, studies show. Unprotected sex can increase your risk of catching a sexually transmitted disease or infection and increase your chances for an unplanned pregnancy.  And while serving as a social lubricant, drinking alcohol actually leaves you dehydrated. The body needs a certain level of hydration and blood flow for sexual arousal. Drinking too much makes it difficult for men to have an erection and for women to feel pleasure from natural lubrication, studies have shown.  Marijuana may have a similar impact as alcohol in lowering your inhibitions and reducing your anxiety, but some studies have shown men have a harder time finding pleasure during sex under the influence.  A couple of studies found that men who use marijuana regularly had more problems with erectile dysfunction and needed medication to counteract that side effect. There are no similar studies that look at women’s sexual satisfaction under the influence of pot. ’I like weed and I’m a good person’   health risks, Over time, drinking can lead to liver disease, neurological problems, certain psychiatric issues and may increase your risk of several types of cancer.  Smoking marijuana is more dangerous than smoking cigarettes, experts say. The tar in joints contains a much higher concentration of the chemicals linked to lung cancer compared with tobacco tar. And smoking marijuana deposits four times more tar in the lungs than smoking an equivalent amount of tobacco, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.  High doses of marijuana can also cause temporary psychotic reactions, such as hallucinations and paranoia in some people. Younger people with a family history of schizophrenia are at a higher risk of developing the disorder after using marijuana, seven studies showed.  Death   About 88, 000 Americans die each year because of excessive alcohol use, according to the CDC. Nearly half of those deaths are from chronic alcohol use    liver failure, for example    while the other half are attributable to acute situations, such as alcohol poisoning or a drunken driving accident. There are an average of 1, 600 alcohol poisoning deaths, or overdoses, each year. Weed can kill you too, as this drug dealer showed. In all seriousness, marijuana affects your reflexes, hindering your motor skills. So   car fatalities are not unheard of.  And one study found marijuana users have a 4.  increase in risk of a heart attack during the first hour after smoking because of the drug’s effect on your heart rate.  That said, scientists believe that a marijuana overdose is highly unlikely. One study found it was safe for animals to consume about 30% of their body weight in cannabis without overdosing that’s the equivalent of a   person eating 48 pounds of weed at one time.  
’Blazing Saddles,’ The Best Interracial Buddy Comedy, Turns 40	2014-02-07	2014	2	Mel Brooks’ Western spoof Blazing Saddles turns 40 Friday, and along with its    jabs at racism and Hollywood, it set the gold standard for what is now an overused cinema trope: the interracial buddy comedy. You’ll have to track down a DVD  —   Blazing Saddles is glaringly absent from Netflix’s streaming service. But here’s the gist of the film: The   State Attorney General Hedley Lamarr (not to be confused with the actress of a similar name, Hedy Lamarr) wants to build a railroad through the quaint fictional town of Rock Ridge. Hoping to scare off the townsfolk and prepare the way for a land grab, Lamarr sends in the first black sheriff, a former railroad worker named Black Bart, played by Cleavon Little. The plan backfires, though, when Bart teams up with local gunslinger Jim (Gene Wilder). Together, they win over the unrepentantly racist town and save Rock Ridge from near destruction. Along the way there are a few gunfights, Mel Brooks as a   Native American chief, Madeline Kahn in a corset, and the invention of the candygram. The end. In his tepid New York Times review, Vincent Canby called the film ”every Western you’ve ever seen turned upside down and inside out.” But the real heart of the movie  —   the ”center of gravity” that Canby lamented was missing from the story  —   is the relationship between Bart and Jim. The Tony   Poitier film The Defiant Ones set the template for interracial buddy films, says Michael Green, senior lecturer of film and media studies at Arizona State University. He cites Hernan Vera and Andrew Gordon, who in their book Screen Saviors: Hollywood Fictions of Whiteness describe the model set by The Defiant Ones as ”two men, one bigoted white and one proud black, are thrown together by circumstance and forced to work together for a common goal.” It was a model later copied by Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner (though its lead male characters were not what you’d call ”buddies”) and In the Heat of the Night, both, not coincidentally, starring Poitier, who at the time was one of the few   stars white audiences were willing to handle. The characters he played were nonsexual and nonthreatening. Hollywood loved him. But by the 1970s  —     rights movement,   War  —   audiences were ready for change. ”Blaxploitation” films in the vein of Shaft marked the first time ”black urban heroes began to take center stage,” Green says. ”That sort of set the stage for Blazing Saddles.” Brooks has never been known for his subtlety, and Blazing Saddles is no exception. Gone are the earnest,   speeches about racial harmony that characterized movies like The Defiant Ones instead, the film,   by Richard Pryor, tackles race and racism   and with humor. (It’s so   that Brooks told Jimmy Kimmel in 2012 he wouldn’t be able to make the film today.) No ethnic or racial stereotype goes unmentioned: Mexican bandidos, Chinese laborers in straw cone hats, Arabs of ambiguous origin riding on camels, and yes, a Jewish Native American, all make cameos in Brooks’ bizarro world, but they’re not the butt of the joke. ”Blazing Saddles is a satire of racism,” Green says. ”That’s what makes it groundbreaking. [Brooks] satirizes racism he shows how stupid it is.” While Black Bart and Jim’s interracial relationship wasn’t the first such   friendship, it was one of the first in which race wasn’t treated as an obstacle. When our two heroes meet, a drunk Jim is hanging upside down from a jail cell bunk Black Bart has just arrived in town, and is watching his new partner with bemusement. ”Are we awake?” Bart asks Jim. ”We’re not sure,” Jim replies. ”Are we . .. black?” ”Yes, we are.” ”Then we’re awake,” Jim says, ”but we’re very puzzled.” So, it’s on the table: Jim is white, and Black Bart is, well, black. There’s no tension to overcome, no   or     moment. Bart and Jim are never pitted against each other they’re allies right off the bat, and the enemy, in this case, is white racism. (Green points out the added layer of Wilder being Jewish, though Jim is not explicitly a Jewish character in the film.) Though Little and Wilder receive about equal screen time, Bart is arguably the true lead, another departure from traditional interracial film relationships, in which the black character usually serves to prop up the white one (think Shawshank Redemption). It’s Black Bart’s show to run, and he takes every available opportunity  —   and there are many  —   to highlight the stupidity of the white racists. Whether he is crooning Cole Porter’s ”I Get No Kick from Champagne” to a white boss demanding a ”good old           work song” or taking himself hostage, Bart, along with his fellow railroad workers, is always in on the joke. It is worth noting that as groundbreaking as Blazing Saddles was in terms of race, the same can’t be said for its treatment of gays and women. The    —   not that one  —   is thrown around liberally, and the four or so women who have lines in the film are either clutching their pearls or taking off their clothes. The movie isn’t   at all when it comes to certain groups. Even though The New York Times failed to appreciate its humor (or make mention of the racial elements of the film) Blazing Saddles was   in 1974. Roger Ebert gave it 4 out of 5 stars, it received three Oscar nominations, and AFI placed it at No. 6 on its list of the Top 100 Funniest American Movies of All Time. Now, four decades on, it remains as biting a satire as ever, and its impact on Hollywood can still be felt. A slew of ”interracial buddy comedies” followed in the wake of Blazing Saddles, including more appearances by Gene Wilder, who paired with Richard Pryor in Silver Streak and Stir Crazy. The 1980s gave us Trading Places and the buddy cop movies 48 Hours, Lethal Weapon and Beverly Hills Cop. They all pulled off the stunt of using humor to tackle race relations, but after 40 years, the charade feels spent. Can’t Hollywood bring together black and white characters without some kind of contrived setup? After 2010’s Cop Out, starring Tracy Morgan and Bruce Willis, Los Angeles Times reviewer Steven Zeitchik begged, ”Can someone please shoot the interracial buddy cop comedy?” ”In approximately this sequence, those rules include: Two men of different   are thrown together by circumstance (and   Hollywood marketing executives). They chafe at and resist each other in fact, they rub each other so wrong that comedy (and, later, a little bit of drama) ensues. But thanks to a common threat, they finally come to appreciate and help each other. We all feel a little lighter for laughing, and maybe a little elevated to boot, because, hey, if a white cop and a black cop can get along, can’t all of us?” Until Hollywood can offer a new, more realistic take on interracial relationships, you’re better off watching Blazing Saddles.
It Took A Eugenicist To Come Up With ’Moron’	2014-02-10	2014	2	”The idiot is not our greatest problem. He is indeed loathsome. . .. Nevertheless, he lives his life and is done. He does not continue the race with a line of children like himself. . .. It is the moron type that makes for us our great problem.”  Henry H. Goddard, 1912, A hundred years ago being called a moron could get you deported or sent to an insane asylum. You could have thanked psychologist Henry H. Goddard for your troubles. Goddard, a researcher, was fascinated with intelligence. He introduced a measurement for it to the United States. At the time, psychologists lumped people with cognitive disabilities in three broad categories: ”idiot,” ”imbecile” and ” ” (” ” being the least severe). Goddard thought the word was imprecise and unscientific, so he created a replacement. Borrowing a Greek root meaning ”dull” or ”foolish,” he coined the term ”moron.” (It is worth stating the obvious: Today, none of these words are appropriate as medical terms.) To Goddard, these ”morons” posed a serious threat. He claimed there was a link between low intelligence and criminal behavior (he noted ”crimes often seem foolish or silly”). And he worried about the quality of ”American stock.” Goddard was a prominent member of the eugenics movement that flourished in early 20th century America. As his colleague Harry Laughlin testified to Congress, eugenicists believed ”the character of a nation is determined primarily by its racial qualities that is the hereditary physical, mental, and moral or temperamental traits of its people.” They hoped ”better breeding” could rid America of its flaws. An astounding number of states (more than half) passed laws calling for sterilization of the ”unfit,” resulting in an estimated 60, 000 involuntary surgeries. The early 20th century was also a time of   immigration to the United States, with new arrivals hailing mostly from southern and eastern Europe. American eugenicists worried about the influence of these unfamiliar people. For his part, Goddard wanted to ensure there were no ”morons” among them. In 1913, he sent female assistants to Ellis Island to recognize the ” ” by sight (women were more intuitive at this, he thought) and administer his tests. Immigration officers had performed cursory physical and mental health screenings for years, but Goddard’s methods revealed an astounding result: 40 percent of the Jews, Italians and Hungarians tested qualified as ”morons.” He noted in his report, ”Doubtless the thought in every reader’s mind is the same as in ours, that it is impossible that half of such a group of immigrants could be   but we know that it is never wise to discard a scientific result because of apparent absurdity.” The following year deportations for ” ” doubled. Despite being widespread in his day, Goddard’s research findings were eventually challenged and disproved. He admitted some of his best known works were faulty. A book he wrote in 1928 concludes with two major reversals: ”  (the moron) is not incurable” and ”the   do not generally need to be segregated in institutions.” ”As for myself,” he wrote, ”I fear I have gone over to the enemy.” Goddard later moved to Ohio where he would become a professor of clinical and abnormal psychology at Ohio State University. But his most lasting contribution remains one that isn’t generally remembered as being his, the invention of the word ”moron.”

Hotel hermit got $17M to make way for 15 Central Park West	2014-03-02	2014	3	After buying the Mayflower Hotel, the Zeckendorf brothers were legally responsible for buying out and even relocating those living in   apartments in the top floors  —   residents whose leases prevented them from being evicted. They turned to Michael Grabow, a relocation lawyer, “to get the last four bachelors out,” he says. “They’d been there 30 to 35 years each, in tiny little rooms. ” One was 98 and had relatives in Mexico. “After 35 years, he checks out with a single suitcase,” Will Zeckendorf says. “Plus a   check,” Arthur Zeckendorf adds, laughing grimly. The second, an aging   agent, also in his 90s, accepted a similar sum and disappeared. A third went by the name David Jordan, but the developers were shocked to discover when the deal was signed that his real name was Arthur MacArthur IV  —   the son of World War II Gen. Douglas MacArthur. Born in Manila in 1938, Arthur IV appeared four years later on the cover of Life magazine, while his father was running the Pacific war theater. After that, Arthur lived with his parents at the exclusive Waldorf Towers on Park Avenue but dropped from sight following his father’s death in 1964. Spooked by fans of his father, Arthur lived in seclusion. He used the Mayflower money to buy a $650, 000 condominium a few blocks away. It was the first and last time his name appeared in public records as an adult. Then, things got complicated. “Herbert Sukenik’s profile was a nightmare,” says Will Zeckendorf. “Hugely intelligent, a Ph. D. unmarried, embittered, a loner, disconnected from society, and too smart for his own good. He was not a poor man; he had independent means. ” Sukenik had lived for about 30 years atop the Mayflower, two flights of stairs above its highest elevator landing. His tiny room had “mold growing up the walls,” says Will. He sounded as if he’d be easy to please. “I don’t want money,” he told the developers. “I just want a new apartment with a park view. ” Herbert J. Sukenik was born in The Bronx in 1930. His father’s brother was the Israeli archaeologist who first recognized the importance of the Dead Sea Scrolls. Herbert’s father, conversely, was a pharmacist who’d been arrested and found guilty in the 1950s for selling amphetamines without prescriptions. Herbie breezed thought Cornell University in just three years, earning a physics degree. He went on to get a master’s in physics, a Ph. D. in physics and an M. D. After a stint at the General Electric Research laboratory, he was named chief of space medicine at Martin Company’s Space Systems Division. Sukenik never married but from college onward stayed in touch with Irwin Shapiro, now an astrophysicist at Harvard. They’d been frat brothers at Cornell. Shapiro called Sukenik annually. “He never called me,” says Shapiro, who thinks his friend had issues. “His father was a strange, strange man. A total mute. In another world. ” In the   Sukenik moved East to work at Massachusetts General Hospital, where he played a role in its earliest installation of computers. “He took a job that was far beneath him,” Shapiro says. “He was angry at the world, but, I thought, angry at his father. ” In August 1974, Sukenik moved to Manhattan and a room at the Mayflower Hotel. “He was very reclusive,” says a younger relative, Herbert Chirlin. Sukenik sometimes worked as a school doctor, but, Shapiro thinks, he finally took to his room and rarely left. Sukenik was 73 when he met Michael Grabow in that    room, which had a kitchenette, a bathroom, four exposures and fabulous views of Central Park and both the East and Hudson rivers. But its windows were so filthy those views could barely be seen. He shared the place with 30 years of scientific journals. It was “a wreck, a mess,” Grabow says. “Clothes everywhere. Papers, magazines, two computers. He had to clear chairs to sit on. ” The Mayflower’s last holdout was short and balding with a wild fringe of gray hair and the “  smell” of someone who “didn’t shower much,” Grabow says. “He was clearly brilliant. ” “I wasted my life,” the embittered Sukenik told Grabow. His father had died while he was finishing his medical degree and left him enough money that he didn’t have to work. “I could have been at the heart of research into CAT scans and MRIs,” Sukenik said. “Instead, I’ve been up here 30 years doing crossword puzzles. ” Grabow learned Sukenik was universally disliked by the Mayflower staff. He never let anyone into his room to clean, even though he was entitled to maid service. “He was a bitcher, a complainer,” says a former Mayflower manager. “He had fun with me,” Grabow says. “He had a nice time beating me up. ” Sukenik knew the precise acreage of his block and how much the Zeckendorfs had paid. He’d calculated the taxes, insurance and carrying costs of the empty properties and recited them all to Grabow. And he wouldn’t begin negotiations until his three fellow tenants were gone. “He knew the last man standing was very valuable. ” His key demand had been a park view, so a broker took him to Essex House on Central Park South and showed him a      unit on the 16th floor. “It looks like a bed of green,” he rhapsodized, staring out at Central Park beneath him. Grabow sent Sukenik a letter spelling out their agreement: The Zeckendorfs would buy the condo and retain ownership, but he could have it for life and they would even furnish it for him. The one demand they refused was free meals twice a week at the Essex House restaurant, then run by the   chef Alain Ducasse. Sukenik’s response to the letter was silence. “Which was not like him,” Grabow says. Then, David Rozenholc, a noted tenants’ attorney, called Grabow, and the moment he started talking, it was clear things had changed. Rozenholc told Grabow that Sukenik wanted more than the apartment and moving expenses. A lot more. Grabow hung up and called Sukenik. “I thought we had a deal,” he said. “We didn’t,” Sukenik replied, “and now I have a lawyer. ” He went on to confirm that he did now want money  —   even though he had no use for it, no kids, no charitable impulse, and didn’t want to leave it to his brother. The Zeckendorfs decided to play hardball. They separated the two halves of the building lobby and began demolishing the southern end. Sukenik’s response? “Oh, I love to watch construction. ” Jackhammers began pounding away for hours a day. “I love the noise,” he said. The Zeckendorfs served Sukenik with papers setting in motion the multiyear   eviction process they’d hoped to avoid. “Finally, it had all come down to a simple question: Where’s the cash?” Will recalls. “This is just a    moment. We’ve got a    property with one tenant. ” The Zeckendorfs turned to a third lawyer who knew Rozenholc. “And finally, we get a number, which is enough to break another phone. ” But at last they had a deal. Fortunately, during Sukenik’s extended silence, they’d bought the Essex House condo, which set them back $2 million. They won’t reveal the additional sum they finally paid Sukenik; Will says only that it was “by far the highest price ever paid to [relocate] a single tenant in the city of New York. ” It was $17 million, according to someone with knowledge of the transaction. In return, Sukenik promised to pay the Zeckendorfs $1 a month in rent. “As a joke,” Rozenholc, who got a third of the settlement, says he gave them a check for $120 for the first 10 years and added a clause to the final agreement requiring them to return a prorated amount if Sukenik died in that time. The first wrecking ball hit the Mayflower two days after Michael Grabow delivered Sukenik’s check. The building that replaced the hotel, 15 CPW, became one of the most exclusive addresses in the city, with residents from   to Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein. Despite his riches, Sukenik lived as a   in his new Essex House apartment until his death at age 80 in January 2011. His estate, valued at $9. 8 million, went to his brother. David Rozenholc can’t recall if the Zeckendorfs ever returned the $48 overpayment on the rent for the Essex House condo. But he spoke to Herb Sukenik several times before he died. “He seemed . . . ,” Rozenholc starts, then pauses. “He had no complaints, but he should have been happier. But some people who should be happy may not be. ”

Victims Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado were killed when shots were fired into their 2003 BMW. Another passenger was wounded and two others were uninjured.  January 30, 2014   The Bristol County District Attorney’s Office alleges Hernandez used ”coded messages” in jailhouse calls to discuss allegations that he killed Odin Lloyd. Prosecutors request recordings of jailhouse calls and records of Hernandez’s visitors since his arrest in June 2013. February 7, 2014   The judge denies the prosecution’s request for the recordings of Hernandez’s jailhouse phone calls.   February 25, 2014   According to the Bristol County Sheriff’s Department, Hernandez is involved in an ”altercation with another inmate.” February 26, 2014   The families of De Abreu and Furtado, the two men gunned down in Boston in 2012, file a wrongful death lawsuit against Hernandez each family is seeking six million dollars.  April 11, 2014   The two friends who were seen in the car with Hernandez on June 17, 2013, Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace, are indicted and charged with Lloyd’s murder.  May 1, 2014   Hernandez is indicted on charges of assault and battery and threatening to do bodily harm, in connection to the February 25 jailhouse altercation. He is also indicted for threats to do bodily harm in connection with a November incident in which he allegedly threatened someone who worked at the jail. May 15, 2014   Hernandez is indicted for the July 2012 murders of de Abreu and Furtado and charged with two counts of   murder, three counts of armed assault with attempt to murder and and one count of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon. May 28, 2014   At his arraignment, Hernandez pleads not guilty. Prosecutors allege that Hernandez killed de Abreu and Furtado after de Abreu bumped into Hernandez at a nightclub, causing the latter to spill his drink.  July 7, 2014   A defense request to have Hernandez moved to a jail closer to Boston is granted. His lawyers argue that the trip from their offices to the Bristol House of Corrections could take up to two hours due to traffic. July 8, 2014   A judge in the civil lawsuit brought by the families of de Abreu and Furtad freezes Hernandez’s $5 million in assets pending the outcome of his   trial. This includes the disputed $3. 3 million Hernandez claims he is owed by the New England Patriots. August 12, 2014   Tanya Singleton, Hernandez’s cousin, pleads guilty to contempt of court for refusing to testify before the grand jury. She is sentenced to two years probation and one year home confinement. She receives home confinement because she has cancer. September 23, 2014   Singleton is sentenced to two years of home confinement after pleading guilty to contempt of court. She was sentenced for a similar offense last month. January 26, 2015   The jury is selected. January 29, 2015   Opening statements by prosecution and defense in Fall River, Massachusetts. Prosecution team:  William McCauley, Patrick Bomberg, Roger Michel, and Brian Griffin. Defense team: Michael Fee, James Sultan, and Charles Rankin.  February 10, 2015   The trial judge releases a decision granting immunity to Jenkins, Hernandez’s fiancee.  February 11, 2015   A second juror is dismissed from the trial. The jury is now made up of 10 women and six men.  April 15, 2015   Hernandez is found guilty of   murder in Lloyd’s death, and is sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. He is also convicted of unlawful possession of a firearm and unlawful possession of ammunition, and his sentences are two and a half years to three years, and six months to three years, respectively. May 11, 2015   Hernandez is indicted in Massachusetts for witness intimidation in the 2013 shooting of Alexander Bradley. Prosecutors believe Bradley to be a witness to the homicides of de Abreu and Furtado, and say Bradley was shot by Hernandez after he made a remark about the double murder.  May 19, 2015   Hernandez is disciplined for allegedly agreeing to be the lookout for an inmate who went into another prisoner’s cell at   Correctional Center, a law enforcement source with knowledge of the incident tells CNN. May 21, 2015   Hernandez pleads not guilty to witness intimidation in the Bradley shooting case. December 3, 2015   According to media reports, Hernandez is found with a homemade knife or a shank in his prison cell, and is moved to a separate part of the prison. February 12, 2016   Hernandez settles a lawsuit filed by Alexander Bradley, who said the football player shot him after a fight at a bar. The terms of the settlement are not released to the public.   May 12, 2016   Ernest Wallace is acquitted of murder but convicted on charges of accessory to murder after the fact in Lloyd’s shooting death in 2013. Wallace is sentenced to a 4½ to 7 year prison term. April 14, 2017   Is found not guilty of murder in the deaths of Furtado and de Abreu outside a nightclub in July 2012. Of the eight counts Hernandez faced, he is found guilty of just one: illegal possession of a firearm.  April 19, 2017   Hernandez is found hanged in his prison cell at 3:05 am. He is pronounced dead at 4:07 am of an apparent suicide, according to the Massachusetts Department of Correction.  April 20, 2017   Hernandez’s family announces they plan to donate his brain to scientists to determine whether he had chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) the degenerative brain disease linked to a number of NFL athletes. The brain will be released to the Boston University CTE Center for further examination, according to the Worcester County District Attorney’s Office. May 9, 2017   A Massachusetts judge vacates Hernandez’s murder conviction. Hernandez’s defense attorneys had asked the court to follow the legal rule called ”abatement ab initio,” or abatement, in which convictions are thrown out if a defendant dies before their appeal is heard.

2008 Georgia Russia Conflict Fast Facts	2014-03-13	2014	3	 (CNN) Here’s some background information about the 2008 military conflict between Russia and Georgia.  Facts:The conflict centered on South Ossetia and Abkhazia, two ”breakaway provinces” in Georgia. They are officially part of Georgia, but have separate, unrecognized governments. Abkhazia and South Ossetia are supported by Russia. Russia has peacekeeping operations in both South Ossetia and Abkhazia.  During the   conflict, 170 servicemen, 14 policemen, and 228 civilians from Georgia were killed and 1, 747 wounded.   Russian servicemen were killed, and 283 were wounded, and 365 South Ossetian servicemen and civilians (combined) were killed, according to an official EU   report about the conflict. Timeline:   Georgia is briefly an independent state after separating from the Russian Empire. 1921   After the Red Army invasion, Georgia is declared a Soviet Socialist republic. April 9, 1991   Georgia declares independence.  1991   South Ossetia declares its independence from Georgia. Heavy fighting breaks out, forcing thousands of people to flee their homes.      Civil war breaks out in Georgia. Zviad Gamsakhurdia is deposed as president.  1992   Abkhazia declares its independence from Georgia, leading to armed conflict.  October 1992   Eduard Shevardnadze is elected to lead Georgia. He is   in 1995 and 2000.  September 1993   Abkhazian separatist forces defeat the Georgian military. October 1993   Georgia joins the Commonwealth of Independent States.  May 1994   A ceasefire is agreed upon and signed between the Georgian government and Abkhaz separatists. Russian peacekeeping forces are deployed to the area. October 2001   Fighting resumes between Abkhaz troops and Georgian paramilitaries. Russia states that it believes Georgia is harboring Chechen rebels, a claim denied by Georgia.  September 2002   Russian President Vladimir Putin sends a letter to UN   Kofi Annan, UN Security Council members, and members of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe stating that Georgia must respond to accusations they are harboring Chechen militants or face military action from Russia. October 2002   Tensions with Russia are defused after Eduard Shevardnadze, Georgia’s president, promises to work with Russia to fight Chechen rebels.  November 2003   Shevardnadze is forced to leave office in the ”Rose Revolution.”  July 2005   Under terms of a deal reached in May, Russia starts to withdraw its troops from two   military bases.    2006   Tensions between Georgia and Russia rise again when Georgia demands that Russian peacekeepers in South Ossetia have visas. November 12,  2006   A referendum is voted upon in which South Ossetians overwhelmingly demand independence. In a simultaneous referendum, South Ossetia’s ethnic Georgians, a minority, vote to stay a part of Georgia. The referendum is not recognized by the Georgian government.  November 2007   Russia announces that it has withdrawn its troops that had been based in Georgia since 1991. It retains a peacekeeping presence in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. April 3, 2008   NATO members at a summit in Bucharest, Romania, defer the decision on Georgia and Ukraine’s admittance until December 2008. April 21, 2008   Georgia accuses Russia of shooting down an unmanned drone over Abkhazia on April 20. Russia denies the claim.  April 29, 2008   Russia sends more troops to Abkhazia to counter what it says are Georgia’s plans for an attack. May 26, 2008   A UN investigation concludes that the drone shot down on April 21 was struck by a missile from a Russian fighter jet.  May   2008   Russia sends several hundred unarmed troops to Abkhazia, saying they are needed for railway repairs. Georgia accuses Russia of planning a military intervention. August   2008   South Ossetian separatists begin attacking Georgian peacekeepers, ending a ceasefire. Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili sends troops into South Ossetia. Russia responds by moving its troops to the border, flying aircraft over Georgia, and beginning air strikes in South Ossetia. August 8, 2008   The United States, Great Britain and NATO call for a cease fire of military hostilities by both Russia and Georgia. August 9, 2008   A delegation of EU and US diplomats head to Georgia to resolve escalating tensions. August 10, 2008   Russia moves tanks and soldiers through South Ossetia and into Georgia proper, advancing towards the city of Gori.  August 12, 2008   Russia calls a halt to its military incursion into Georgia and agrees to a   diplomatic push for peace. The plan is announced by French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev.   August 13, 2008   President George W. Bush announces humanitarian aid is to be sent to Georgia. It is also announced that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will be sent to France and Georgia for a diplomatic mission. August 15, 2008   Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili signs a cease fire agreement with Russia. The deal is brokered by French President Nicolas Sarkozy.  August 16, 2008   Russian President Dmitry Medvedev signs the cease fire agreement.  August 22, 2008   Russia completes its troop withdrawal from Georgia, as part of the cease fire agreement.  August 26, 2008   Russian President Dmitry Medvedev signs an order recognizing the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. In response, US President George W. Bush releases a statement saying, ”The United States condemns the decision by the Russian president to recognize as independent states the Georgian regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. The territorial integrity and borders of Georgia must be respected, just as those of Russia or any other country.” July 2009   UN observers leave Georgia after 16 years. The mission was not extended due to a Russia veto.  September 2009   A report from an EU   mission determines that the 2008 conflict was caused by Georgia’s illegal attack on the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali on August  .  January 27, 2016   The   International Criminal Court authorizes a probe into possible war crimes committed by Russian, Georgian and South Ossetian forces during the conflict.    
MH370 possibly plunged straight into ocean, expert says	2014-03-21	2014	3	 (CNN) It has been 15 months since Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing did an unexplained   flew in the wrong direction and disappeared without a trace with 239 souls on board. In the absence of physical evidence, theories on what happened to the plane continue to proliferate: The crew passed out. It was pilot suicide. Or was it a paranormal event? Now comes the latest contribution to the debate: This week, a mathematician from Texas AM University announced that he had run data through a computer and determined it was likely the plane had plunged vertically into the ocean. Goong Chen, using ”applied mathematics, computational fluid dynamics and numerical simulations of a Boeing 777 in a classic ’water entry’ problem,” determined that a plane that piercing vertically into the sea would not break apart. Simply put, a plane hitting the water at an angle would scatter its parts across the surface of the water. But one hitting at a   angle would shoot into the water with minimal damage and zoom straight to the bottom. Never mind that the Indian Ocean is more than seven times the size of the United States    a rather large area to search. The theory of the vertical dive, said Chen and his colleagues, explains why no debris has been found. The study was published in the April 2015 issue of Notices of the American Mathematical Society. Chen offers no theories on why the plane might have been in a vertical descent. And he does offer a caveat. ”The true final moments of MH370 are likely to remain a mystery until someday when its black box is finally recovered and decoded,” he writes. But that has not stopped theories to sprout like weeds in an untended garden. Among those that have been circulated: Theory: Ghost or zombie plane, Some speculation has centered on the   ”zombie theory” advanced by aviation specialist Clive Irving of The Daily Beast. A ghost plane is one where everyone aboard    pilots, crew, passengers    loses consciousness because of a loss of pressurization, an explosion, smoke or fumes. Under this supposition, the Malaysia plane continued to fly for hours on autopilot until it ran out of fuel. In 1999, a Lear jet carrying professional golfer Payne Stewart and four others crashed in South Dakota after flying on its own for four hours. All aboard had died when the cabin lost pressure. ”I think in the first few minutes of this emergency, the pilots had to change course because they were looking for an emergency airport,” Irving said about the Malaysian flight. ”They were at some point overtaken by whatever it was, smoke, fire, or some kind of problem. And the plane was then left to fly itself after it had been programmed to go on that course.” The mystery of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370: What you need to know, CNN aviation analyst Les Abend considers the thesis ”very viable.”  ”It can happen insidiously if it’s a slow situation,” Abend said. ”But my scenario is a smoldering fire that created smoke and once that smoke began the crew donned their oxygen masks.” The plane’s captain may have ”realized it was compelling enough to get the airplane turned and entered a waypoint that was an alternate airport in the flight management computer and kept the autopilot connected because this plane is designed, especially in an emergency situation to reduce workload,” Abend said. Theory: Incapacitated crew, The crew may have become incapacitated and unable to land the plane, said former pilot Alastair Rosenschein, causing the plane to crash in the south Indian Ocean, where numerous searches have taken place. With the crew incapacitated, none of the passengers would have had the ability to control the plane or issue a distress call. If the plane ran out of fuel while on autopilot, the landing at sea would have the same path as one on land, said Mitchell Casado, a Boeing 777 pilot trainer.  For MH370 families, hope hangs by a thread after Reunion discovery, ”It’s not going to be any dramatic nose down or turning or anything like that. It’s just going to be a very gentle, gradual descent    very similar, actually, to what you would experience in a regular flight,” Casado said. ”Just a very gradual descent but constant until you hit the ground.” Theory: Terrorism, Malaysian military radar registered dramatic altitude changes for Flight 370    rising to 45, 000 feet and then descending to 23, 000 feet    as it moved across Malaysia, according to a senior U. S. official. The official cautioned that the readings are not believed entirely accurate. Still, analysts surmise causes for the altitude changes. ”Some of the flight profile changes might suggest that the flight was commandeered,” said Robert Goyer,    of Flying magazine and a commercial   pilot. ”Was it by one of the pilots or by an intruder? It would be more likely that it was . .. by one of the pilots.” Theory: Pilot heroism or suicide? Inevitably, attention turns to whether the pilot or   tried to destroy the aircraft. Those theories can only grow more insistent in the wake of the crash of a Germanwings plane in the French alps earlier this year, in which the   Andreas Lubitz, is believed to have downed the plane deliberately in a mass  . Among the disturbing circumstances of MH370’s disappearance is that its transponder and communication systems were off shortly after takeoff. Some experts have advanced the possibility that the pilots or crew were bent on the annihilation of everyone aboard the plane. Lives, not numbers: Snapshots of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 passengers, ”It’s my belief that there was probably some type of struggle in the cockpit where it was one of the pilots that maybe had a meltdown or did something nefarious to the airplane,” said Mark Weiss, a retired American Airlines pilot captain who has flown the Boeing 777. Theories: The bizarre, Some Internet users have ventured into the bizarre and paranormal. Some assert a meteor struck the plane. But the astronomical odds against such an event are high, to put it mildly. Lisa Williams, a psychic in California, said she believed the plane went down somewhere with its passengers still alive, though she doesn’t have proof. ”I do believe that it actually crashed and I see a lot of trees . . . ” Williams said. ”I also believe there was a hijacking.” But Abend, the aviation analyst, dismissed Williams’ speculation. ”With( out) disparaging Lisa’s profession, I mean, listen, I’m an airline pilot. I deal in black and white,” Abend said. ”It’s difficult for me to, in this particular circumstance, to think that a psychic could solve a problem that people all over the world are not able to solve at this point.” Underwater search for MH370 could end next year, Complete coverage of MH370 
Hitless Ellsbury at center of tough start	2014-04-03	2014	4	HOUSTON  —   Outside of Masahiro Tanaka, the biggest splash the Yankees made last offseason was the signing of Jacoby Ellsbury. Despite his $153 million price tag, he’s not treating his sluggish start any differently than he would at any other point in his career. “I think regardless of what my contract is, I play the same way I did my first year,” Ellsbury said after his second hitless night in a   loss to Houston. “I do everything the same when I’m on the field. None of that other stuff matters. ” While he hasn’t picked up any hits, Ellsbury has been pretty pleased with his   including his walk and stolen base in the seventh Wednesday. “I was happy with that,” Ellsbury said of the swipe, which put him in scoring position as the potential tying run before Derek Jeter struck out to end the inning. “They knew I was going, it was just a matter of when. ” Still, he would like to have a hit next to his name at some point. “It will be nice when we get all the firsts out of the way,” Ellsbury said. “That goes for hits and wins. It’ll happen. It’s gonna come. ” It probably doesn’t help that the Astros’ new center fielder and leadoff hitter, Dexter Fowler, has pounded Yankees pitching during the series. Maybe the Yankees acquired the wrong center fielder. Fowler, who the Astros got in a trade with Colorado this offseason, had a pair of doubles in Tuesday’s opener and then topped that with a leadoff homer off Hiroki Kuroda in Wednesday’s   win, followed by a standup triple to center that sent Ellsbury back to the ridiculous hill in the deepest part of the outfield at Minute Maid Park. It’s been a rough beginning for Ellsbury, who was bothered by a tight right calf for much of the latter part of spring training. And although he insisted his timing would be fine for the regular season, the results have yet to follow. Ellsbury has hardly been alone in his slow start to 2014. Mark Teixeira struck out three times Wednesday and Alfonso Soriano has fanned twice in each of the first two games. On the bright side, Ellsbury’s balky calf  —   which seemed to cause him as much discomfort to talk about as it did on the field  —   hasn’t shown any signs of affecting him while chasing the bombs hit off Kuroda and CC Sabathia. But the Yankees splurged on the former Boston star to spark their offense and that has yet to happen.
As La. Coast Recedes, Battle Rages Over Who Should Pay	2014-04-16	2014	4	Louisiana’s coast is disappearing at the rate of about a football field an hour. Since the 1930s, the Gulf of Mexico has swallowed up an area the size of Delaware. You can see the water encroaching in Delacroix in St. Bernard Parish, less than an hour southeast of New Orleans. Here, a narrow crescent of land known locally as the ”end of the world” is where the road abruptly comes to a dead end in the distance, you see the tops of   trees. ”It’s hard to imagine if the coast continues to erode and enormous amounts of money are not invested in protecting it, that New Orleans could survive,” says historian John Barry. Barry is known for his book Rising Tide, about the 1927 Mississippi River flood. Most recently, he was vice president of the Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection   and pushed a lawsuit alleging that oil and gas companies destroyed land that once served as a buffer protecting New Orleans from hurricanes. ”The loss of this land has increased the storm surge on the flood protection authority’s property  —   the levees  —   and made our burden much greater,” he says. ’Sending A Message’ The authority is responsible for maintaining an elaborate new levee system built after Hurricane Katrina, an endeavor expected to cost about $40 million a year. And it’s not the only one looking for energy companies to pay up: Two Louisiana parishes are also suing for coastal restoration. The litigious environment discourages business investment, says Gifford Briggs, vice president of the Louisiana Oil and Gas Association. ”That’s sending a message to the oil and gas industry that if you want to operate in Louisiana, you have to be prepared to be sued,” Briggs says. He rejects claims that companies are to blame for about a third of Louisiana’s land loss because of the canals they cut through wetlands. ”In the ’60s and ’70s, when we were doing exploration in coastal Louisiana, we had to create canals. So from a standpoint of land loss, it’s clear that when you dig a canal or create a canal, that there’s land lost,” he says. ”But being responsible for the coastal erosion side of it, that’s not something we feel like we’re responsible for.” Briggs says the reason Louisiana has a coastal land crisis is not oil and gas activity, but the way the Mississippi River has been controlled by the federal government. Flood protection systems prevent sediment from flowing downstream to replenish the Delta. ”Trying to blame us for something that is really the responsibility of the Army Corps of Engineers is really nothing more than just a money grab,” Briggs says. ’Let’s Have The Court Decide’ Somebody should pay, says Stephen Estopinal, current vice president of the Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection  . He says the courtroom is the logical place to decide who should pay what. ”You bring ’em in the court, and let’s have the court decide. That is the conservative thing to do,” Estopinal says. ”The liberal thing to do would be to have Uncle Sam come in and make it all better.” Estopinal is a surveyor and civil engineer from St. Bernard Parish, and has measured firsthand the disappearing coast. He says he’s not out to cast oil companies as the lone villain. ”I don’t want the oil and gas industry to take the whole bullet, because they’re a very important industry. I like gas in my car. I also like to have a home to go back to,” he says. ”We’re not talking about inconvenience, we’re not talking about the little birdies, or how nice things looked before and how bad they look now. We’re talking about survival.” The prospect of a legal fight has sparked an epic political battle in Baton Rouge. Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal and state GOP leaders are pushing bills to retroactively quash the lawsuits. Oil and gas severance taxes make up about 10 percent of the state’s general fund budget. State Senate transportation committee Chairman Robert Adley worked most of his career in the oil and gas business. He says it is bad policy to target a key industry that had permission from the state to develop its natural resources. ”I don’t believe that anyone ought to be sued or exploited for doing what they were told to do,” Adley says. ”Now, it’s easy to argue about the big bad oil companies and that kind of thing, but the truth of the matter is, we as a people, we want what they have.” Proponents of the lawsuits say it’s the other way around. ”Oil companies can’t leave Louisiana. We’ve got what they want,” says Democrat Foster Campbell, a public service commissioner. ”Here we have in Louisiana for years and years and years kowtowed to the oil companies under the threat we will leave Louisiana. They’re not leaving Louisiana. We’re where the oil is. We’re where the gas is. We’re where the delivery system is for America.” And America needs what Louisiana has. The question is just who should pay to keep Louisiana intact.
4/20: National Weed Day, explained	2014-04-19	2014	4	 It’s   the day tens of thousands of Americans gather around the country to celebrate a drug that remains illegal in most of the country: marijuana.    April 20 (or  ) is cherished by pot smokers around the world as a reason to toke up with friends and massive crowds each year. Major rallies occur across the country, particularly in places like Colorado and California, where marijuana is now legal. But as support for marijuana legalization grows, the festivities are becoming more mainstream. As a result, marijuana businesses are looking to leverage the holiday to find more ways to sell and market their products. This puts  ’s current iteration in sharp contrast with the holiday once embraced by a counterculture movement that was largely made up of hippies and others who decried greed, corporate influences, and all things mainstream. And that tells us a lot about how weed is changing in America. Why is   National Weed Day? There are a few theories. There are a few possible explanations for why marijuana enthusiasts’ day of celebration landed on April 20, but the real origin remains a bit of a mystery.    Steven Hager, a former editor of the   news outlet High Times, told the New York Times that the holiday came out of a ritual started by a group of high school students in the 1970s. As Hager explained, a group of Californian teenagers ritualistically smoked marijuana every day at 4:20 pm. The ritual spread, and soon 420 became code for smoking marijuana. Eventually 420 was converted into   for calendar purposes, and the day of celebration was born. (A group of Californians published documents giving this theory legitimacy, but it’s unclear if their claims are valid.)    One common belief is that 420 was the California police or penal code for marijuana, but there’s no evidence to support those claims.            Another theory is that there are 420 active chemicals in marijuana, hence an obvious connection between the drug and the number. But there are more than 500 active ingredients in marijuana, and only about 70 or so are cannabinoids unique to the plant, according to the Dutch Association for Legal Cannabis and Its Constituents as Medicine.    A   possibility comes from the 1939 short story ”In the Walls of Eryx” by H. P. Lovecraft and Kenneth Sterling. The story describes ”curious  ” that seemed fairly similar to marijuana and appeared to get the narrator high at, according to his watch, around 4:20. Since the story is from 1939, it’s perhaps the earliest written link between marijuana and 420. Whatever its origins,   has become a massive holiday for cannabis aficionados.   is the biggest   celebration of marijuana What   stands for varies from person to person. Some people just want to get high and have fun. Others see the day as a moment to push for legalization, or celebrate legalization now that more states are adopting it and it has popular opinion behind it.    Back in the 1970s,   was part of a smaller counterculture movement that embraced marijuana as a symbol to protest against broader systemic problems in the US, like overseas wars and the power of corporations in America. ”Marijuana was the way you said you weren’t a suit,” Keith Humphreys, a drug policy expert at Stanford University, previously told me.            In recent years, marijuana legalization activists have tried to bring a more formal aspect to the celebration, framing it as a moment to push their political agenda. Organizers for the 2014 Denver rally  —   during the first year marijuana sales were legal in the state  —   put out a statement comparing the battle for legal marijuana to ”the time when Jews fled from slavery in Egypt,” a moment commemorated in Passover celebrations. ”This year’s rally represents the continuing fight for freedom from economic slavery for marginalized members of our community and a rebirth of creative genius that will get us there,” they wrote. Businesses are also trying to take advantage of the holiday. Eddie Miller, CEO of Invest in Cannabis, which seeks to bring investment into the marijuana industry, previously told me that his company was trying to build and sponsor major   gatherings around the country  —   similar to what other companies, some of which Miller has been involved with, have done with holidays like St. Patrick’s Day. ”Our perspective is   is a real holiday  —   no smaller than St. Patrick’s Day or Halloween,” Miller said. ”It’s just nobody knows about it yet. And our company is going to let everyone know about it.” Legalization is turning   into a commercial holiday Originally   was a counterculture holiday to protest, at least in part, the social and legal stigmas against marijuana. Marijuana legalization undercuts that purpose: As big businesses and corporations begin growing and selling pot, marijuana will slowly lose its status as a counterculture symbol  —   and that, Humphreys of Stanford University speculated, could bring the end of the traditional, countercultural  . ”If a corporate marijuana industry adopts   it would still be a celebrated event, but not with the same countercultural meaning,” Humphreys said in an email. ”People celebrated Christmas long before it became an occasion for an orgy of   and materialist consumption, but the meaning of the holiday for most people was different then than it is now.”    Companies such as Invest in Cannabis admit they’re already leveraging the holiday as another opportunity to promote the industry and its products  —   much like beer and other alcohol companies now do with St. Patrick’s Day. ”The media is covering   as a consumer interest story,” Miller of Invest in Cannabis said. ”But some portion of the media is covering   as a call to arms for the industry  —   so [in 2015] there are multiple competitive business conferences that are happening in Denver, the [San Francisco] Bay Area, and Las Vegas.”            The pot industry has also gotten directly involved in   events. The Cannabis Cup, for example, has become a major event at Denver’s   rallies, where hundreds of vendors show off their finest marijuana products to more than 40, 000 attendees. The event has steadily grown over the years, featuring big concerts from notable musicians like Snoop Dogg, Soja, and 2 Chainz, as well as a wide collection of marijuana businesses as sponsors. The Cannabis Cup is only one of many events, which also include comedy shows (like Cheech and Chong)   speed dating, and trade shows for glass pipes and bongs, offering businesses and celebrities various opportunities to push their products and brands. Some people don’t attend the public festivities at all, choosing instead to stay home and enjoy a joint (or more) with their friends. For them,   likely remains a more casual affair void of big sponsorships and marketing. But in public,   is increasingly becoming a commercial holiday.     ’s shift shows how marijuana legalization will change weed The shift in   from a counterculture holiday to a more corporate one shows how legalization is changing marijuana. To many legalizers, this is a sign of their success. Legalization campaigns often adopt the tagline ”regulate marijuana like alcohol.” That this is actually happening as the cannabis industry takes a form similar to the alcohol industry is a sign that legalizers are winning. But to some drug policy experts and legalizers, this is a cause for alarm. The big concern is that a big marijuana industry will, like the tobacco and alcohol industries, irresponsibly market its drug to kids or users who already consume the drug excessively  —   with little care for public health over the desire for profits. To this end, many drug policy experts see alcohol as a warning, not something to be admired and followed for other drugs. For decades, big alcohol has successfully lobbied lawmakers to block tax increases and regulations on alcohol, all while marketing its product as fun and sexy in television programs, such as the Super Bowl, that are viewed by millions of Americans, including children. Meanwhile, alcohol is linked to 88, 000 deaths each year in the US.            If marijuana companies are able to act like the tobacco and alcohol industries have in the past, there’s a good chance that they’ll convince more Americans to try or even regularly use marijuana, and some of the heaviest users may use more of the drug. And as these companies increase their profits, they’ll be able to influence lawmakers in a way that could stifle regulations or other policies that curtail cannabis misuse. All of that will likely prove bad for public health. Now, the situation almost certainly will not be as bad as alcohol, since alcohol is simply more dangerous than marijuana. Pot’s risks, for one, tend to be nonfatal or at least much less fatal than alcohol: dependence and overuse, accidents,   overdoses that lead to mental anguish and anxiety, and, in rare cases, psychotic episodes. Marijuana has never been definitively linked to any serious ailments  —   not deadly overdoses, lung disease, or schizophrenia. And it’s much less likely  —   around   so, based on data for fatal car crashes  —   to cause deadly accidents than alcohol.    Given this, the focus for drug policy experts tends to be the risk of dependence. As Jon Caulkins, a drug policy expert at Carnegie Mellon University, has told me, ”At some level, we know that spending more than half of your waking hours intoxicated for years and years on end is not increasing the likelihood that you’ll win a Pulitzer Prize or discover the cure for cancer.” But these risks are still risks. Yet as the marijuana industry grows, it’s likely that these will be issues that the industry just doesn’t care much about  —   and it will market its product excessively for as much profit as possible, even if it means more public health or safety problems along the way. Today,   is an example of this shift in action  —   showing cannabis’s evolution from a counterculture symbol to just another commodity that big companies can make a lot of money from. 
"""You’re Shakespeare, but you’re playing Hamlet as well"": Gregory Rabassa on translation"	2014-04-20	2014	4	 Gregory Rabassa, who died Tuesday, was a literary translator, specializing in English translations of Spanish and Portuguese original works. He is perhaps best known for his work with Gabriel Garcia Marquez, who called Rabassa’s translation of  One Hundred Years of Solitude better than the Spanish original.     We spoke to him on the phone in 2014, after Marquez’ death. The then    Rabassa was still sharp, but his wife asked us to print out the interview and send it to him  —   he didn’t use the internet.  A lightly edited transcript, interspersed with excerpts from Rabassa’s memoir If This Be Treason, follows. Dara Lind: When did you first meet Garcia Marquez? Gregory Rabassa: I haven’t had much physical contact with him, because he’s living in Mexico and he travels a lot, but I saw him in New York when he was up here. It was very brief. But I had a correspondence with him, mainly to do the translation. And I’d get news back and forth from Julio Cortazar, who I knew quite well. But I didn’t have much personal contact with Gabo.    DL: When you did meet him in person, did it confirm your impression from his writing? GR: I knew he was an affable person, which he was. And  . That was the last time he was able to come to the States, I think, because of his Cuban position. The State Department was down on him because of his friendship with Fidel (Castro).    DL: In your correspondence, what language did you use? GR: I wrote Spanish. Because I wasn’t sure of his English. But I think his English was better than he made it out to be.   A word that Gabo enjoys throwing about in a lot of his writing as an expletive but more often than not as a descriptive term is mierda, excrement. [.  …    ] It was a favorite word of the novel’s unnamed patriarch and as such it was absolutely essential that it appear in English in its correct earthy and expressive translation. This is how I did it, causing great distress at The New Yorker. I was given to understand that any number of   editorial meetings were held to decide what to do about the word, which had never appeared in the magazine before. [. ..] Since then I have liked to trumpet the news that in a triumph even greater than his winning the Nobel Prize, García Márquez broke the shit barrier at The New Yorker.  —  from If This Be Treason Cover via www. harpercollins. com   DL: Have you traveled to Colombia? GR: I didn’t get to his birthplace, but I did go to Cartagena, which he knew very well, and to Bogota. I met some friends of his there  —   we had a lot of friends in common. It was a long time ago, it must have been twenty years ago. DL: So, after you had translated his works. GR: Yes. DL: Did you see anything that you recognized from what you’d translated, or that shed a new light on his work? GR: I didn’t find Colombia that different from other Latin American countries which I knew. If you’re familiar with the Hispanic culture, you’ll find it in most of the countries. Here and there, the geography is different. But that’s regional. There wasn’t anything peculiar, shall we say, in Colombia. The stories could take place in Venezuela or Mexico itself. DL: So you’d disagree with those who say that Garcia Marquez is an ineffably Colombian writer. GR: Oh, yes. He’s universal. He reminds me very much of Cervantes. The Quijote is very Spanish  —   but it’s universal. ”THAT IS A TERRIBLE DRAWBACK FOR A TRANSLATOR WHO WANTS TO SIT DOWN AND HAVE A GOOD READ. ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU START TRANSLATING” DL: Did Gabo ever write you with complaints, or corrections? GR: No. In fact, he said that (One Hundred Years of Solitude) was better in English. I took that to be a compliment to the English language. He should have written the book in English. DL: When you read his later works, do you read the English translation or the Spanish? GR: I read the Spanish. I look at the English version. Edie Grossman (Garcia Marquez’ later translator) does a good job. DL: Any differences between her style and yours? GR: Maybe tone  —   I think I tended to be a little more lyrical, perhaps a little more adventurous. Other than that, I always let the text lead me, so it’s hard to say. I didn’t do a    comparison, with the Spanish in front of me. I didn’t think that was proper. I’ll leave that to Professor Horrendo (Rabassa’s name for the pedants who nitpick his translations).   In Spanish it had been Cronica de una muerte anunciada and my title immediately fell prey to the pedantic pecking of cocksure commentators. It was pointed out that it should have been ”Chronicle of an Announced Death.” I hadn’t heard a clinker like that in a long time. I could only think of the late Penn Station and a booming voice announcing the departure of some poor soul to the nether world. [. ..] Quite often I come across the cutesy phrase ”chronicle of a ____ foretold” used in some way or another. I can’t see how ”announced” could possibly have ever caught on like that.  —  from If This Be Treason Cover via www. randomhouse. com  DL: Were there any of his works that you wished you had been the translator for, or that you caught yourself translating as you read? GR: I’m essentially lazy, and I’m glad someone else did them. But that is a terrible drawback for a translator who wants to sit down and have a good read. All of a sudden you start translating a phrase here, a phrase there. It slows you down. You have to separate the language. If I’m reading French, I want to read French, and not an English translation, as I go along. And if I’m reading an English translation, I’d rather just read the translation. (Translating while reading) is just too damn pedantic. DL: But you’ve said that you can see the original language ’”lurking behind” a translation. GR: I can feel it sometimes. I can’t put my finger on it, but I feel that if you translate a phrase into English from Spanish, it’s different from what the phrase would be in Spanish. Grammar may be an influence, part of this. Spanish grammar, in English, it might sound a little archaic. That’s actually my mythical project that I want to do, is translate One Hundred Years into Virgilian pentameter and make it a Latin epic. That’s what Borges would like.   I knew I had something good before me. People who had read the novel in Spanish were talking about it intelligently, sometimes not so intelligently, but always with a kind of awe. I suppose that this should have scared me off, but in matters of translation and a few other things I don’t frighten easily.  —  from If This Be Treason Cover via www. harpercollins. com    DL: You’ve compared translation to music at times, to acting at other times. What’s the best metaphor for what translating Gabo was like? GR: The strongest would be acting. You’re playing a role. When you do Shakespeare, you are Shakespeare in a way, because you’re coming out with the lines he wrote. But you’re playing Hamlet as well. A novel is closest to acting, because you’re saying his words  —   but he has characters as well. It’s most like acting in mood, and word choice. And sometimes you have to ad lib. There are some things you can’t do directly  —   if you get the proper translation, and it just doesn’t seem right, you have to add your own words. ”i took that to be a compliment to the english language. he should have written the book in english.” DL: Any last thoughts? GR: I only wish that I had known him better personally. I sort of miss that contact. I didn’t have that much. The occasional letter. Some of my authors I got to know, like Julio Cortazar. Gabo seems like a good person to know.

37 Who Saw Murder Didn’t Call the Police - The New York Times	2014-05-08	2014	5	For more than half an hour 38 respectable, law‐abiding cit izens in Queens watched a killer stalk and stab a woman in three separate attacks in Kew Gardens. Twice the sound of their voices and the sudden glow of their bedroom Iights interrupted him and frightened him off. Each time he returned, sought her out and stabbed her again. Not one person telephoned ‐ the po lice during the assault one wit ness called after the woman was dead.’ ”That was two weeks ago to day. But Assistant Chief In spector Frederick M. Lussen, in charge of the borough’s detec tives and a veteran of 25 years of homicide investigations, is still shocked.” ’He can give a matter‐of‐fact recitation of many murders. But the Kew Gardens slaying baffles him‐not because it is a murder, but because the “good people” failed to call the police. “As we have reconstructed the crime,” he said, “the assail ant had three chances to kill this woman during a 35‐minute period. He returned twice to complete the job. If we had been called when he first at tacked, the woman might not be dead now. ” This is what the police say happened beginnang at 3:20 A. M. in the staid, middle‐cIass, tree‐lined Austin Street area: Twenty‐eight‐year‐o1d Cath erine Genovese, who was called Kitty by almost everyone in the neighborhood, was returning She turned off the lights of her car, locked the door and started to walk the 100 feet to the entrance of her apartment at 82‐70 Austin Street, which is in a Tudor building, with stores on the first floor and apartments on the second. The entrance to the apart ment is in the rear of the   ing because the front is rented to retail stores. At night the quiet neighborhood is shrouded in the slumbering darkness that marks most residential areas. Miss Genovese noticed a man at the far end of the lot, near a seven‐story apartment house at 82‐40 Austin Street. She halted. Then, nervously, she headed up Austin Street to ward Lefferts Boulevard, where there is a call box to the 102d police Precinct in nearby Rich mond Hill. ‘He Stabbed Me!’ She got as far as a street light in front of a bookstore before the man grabbed her. she screamed. Lights went on in the 10‐story apartment house at 82‐67. Austin Street, which faces the bookstore. Windows slid open and voices punctured the early‐morning stillness. Miss Genovese screamed: oh, my God, he stabbed me! Please help me! Please help me !” From one of the upper win down in the apartment house, a man called down: “Let that girl alone !” The assailant looked up at him, shrugged and walked down Austin Street toward a white sedan parked a short distance away. Miss Genovese struggled to her feet. Lights went out. The killer returned to Miss Genovese, now trying to make her way around the side of the building by the parking lot to get to her apart ment. The assailant stabbed her again.’ ”“I’m dying!” she shrieked. “I’m dying!” She shrieked. “I’m dying! ”” ’A City Bus Passed Windows were opened again, and lights went on in many apartments. The assailant got into his car and drove away. Miss Genovese staggered to her feet. A city bus, Q‐10, the Lef ferts Boulevard line to Ken nedy International Airport, passed. It was 3:35 A. M.’ ”The assailant returned. By then, Miss Genovese had crawled to the back of the building, where the freshly painted brown doors to the apartment house held out hope of safety. The killer tried the first door she wasn’t there. At the second ‐ door, 82‐62 Austin Street, he saw her slumped on the floor at the foot of the stairs. He stabbed her a third time —  fatally.” ’It was 3:50 by the time the police received their first call, from a man who was a neighbor of Miss Genovese. In two min utes they were at the scene. The neighbor, a 70‐year‐old woman and another woman were the only persons on the street. No bady else came forward. The man explained that he had called the police after much celiberation. He had phoned a friend in Nassau County for advice and then he had crossed the roof of the building to the apartment of the elderly wo man to get her to make the call.’ ”“I didn’t want to get in volved,” he sheepishly told the police.” ’Suspect Is Arrested Six days later, the police ar rested Winston Moseley, a 29 year‐old   op erator, and charged him with the homicide. Moseley had no previous record. He is married, has two children and owns a home at 133‐19 Sutter Avenue, south ozone Park, Queens. On wednesday, a court committed him to Kings County Hospital for psychiatric observation. When questioned by the po lice, Moseley also said that he had slain Mrs. Annie May John son, 24, of 146‐12 133d Avenue, Jamaica, on Feb. 29 and Bar bara Kralik, 15, of 174‐17 140th Avenue, Springfield Gardens, last July. In the Kralik case, the police are holding Alvin L. Mitchel1, who is said to have confessed that slaying. The police stressed how sim‐ ple it would have been to have gotten in touch with them. “A phone call,” said one of the de tectives, “would have done it. ” The police may be reached by dialing . “O” for operator or SPring  .’ ”The question of whether the witnesses can be held legally responsible in any way for fail ure to report the crime was put to the Police Department’s legai bureau. There, a spokesman said :” ’“There is no legal responsibil‐ity with few exceptions, for any citizen to report a crime. ” Statutes Explained Under the statutes of the city, he said, a witness to a suspicibus or violent death must report it to the medical examiner. Under state law, a witness cannot withhold infor mation in a kidnapping.’ ”Today witnesses from the neighborhood, which is made up   homes in the $35, 000 to $60, 000 range with the exception of the two apartment. houses near the railroad sta tion, find it difficult to explain why they didn’t call the police.” ’Lieut Bernard Jacobs, who handled the investigation by the, detectives, said: “It is one of the better neigh borhoods. There are few re ports of crimes. You only get’ ”Path of Victim: Stabber’s Third Attack Was Fatal” ’The police said most persons had told them they had been afraid to call, but had given meaningless answers when asked what they had feared. “We can understand the reti cence of people to become in volved in an area of violence,” Lieutenant Jacobs said, “but where they are in their homes, near phones, why should they be afraid to call the police?” He said his men were able to piece together what happened  —  and capture the suspect‐be cause the residents furnished all the information when detec tives rang doorbells during the days following the slaying.’ ”“But why didn’t someone call us that night ?” he asked un believingly.” ’Witnesses —  some of them un able to believe what they had allowed to happen —  told a re porter why.’ ”A housewife, knowingly if quite casual, said, “We thought it was a lover’s quarrel. ” A husband and wife both said, “Frankly, we were afraid. ” They seemed aware of the fact that events might have been” ’One couple, now willing to talk about that night, said they heard the first screams. The husband looked thoughtfully at the bookstore where the killer first grabbed Miss Genovese. “We went to the window to see what was happening,” he said, “but the light from our bedroom made it difficult to see the street. ” The wife, still ap prehensive, added: “I put out the light and we were able to see better. ”’ ”Asked why they hadn’t called the police, she shrugged and re plied: “I don’t know. ”” ”A man peeked out from a slight opening in the doorway to his apartment and rattled off an account of the killer’s second attack. Why hadn’t he called the police at the time? “I was tired,” he said without emotion. “I went back to bed. ”” ’It was 4:25 A. M. when the ambulance arrived for the body of Miss Genovese.

"Yellowstone has a 50 square mile ""Zone of Death"" where you can get away with murder"	2014-05-22	2014	5	 Let’s imagine Daniel and Henry are vacationing in Yellowstone National Park, and set up camp in the 50 square miles of the park that are in Idaho (unlike most of the park, which is in Wyoming). They get into a fight and Daniel winds up killing Henry. But rather than bury the body and try to cover up the crime, Daniel freely admits to it and surrenders himself to the authorities.    At his trial, he invokes his right, under the Sixth Amendment, to a jury composed of people from the state where the murder was committed (Idaho) and from the federal district where it was committed. But here’s the thing  —   the District of Wyoming has purview over all of Yellowstone, even the parts in Montana or Idaho. So Daniel has the right to a jury composed entirely of people living in both Idaho and the District of Wyoming  —   that is, people living in the Idaho part of Yellowstone. No one lives in the Idaho part of Yellowstone. A jury cannot be formed, and Daniel walks free. That scenario is fiction, but all the legal maneuvers Daniel employs are completely legitimate, and someone in a similar situation could quite possibly get off scot free. That got a lot of attention when it was first pointed out by Michigan State law professor Brian Kalt in his 2005 Georgetown Law Journal article, ”The Perfect Crime.” After all, it implied that there was a 50 square mile ”Zone of Death” of the United States where you can commit crimes with impunity, like in The Purge or something. The scenario even got featured in a   mystery novel, Free Fire by CJ Box, who consulted Kalt when writing the book. What’s more, the Zone of Death had a simple fix: Congress could simply pass a law placing Idaho’s portions of Yellowstone inside the District of Idaho. Montana’s less of a problem, since a handful of people actually do live in its part of Yellowstone and could be summoned as a jury, but Congress might as well give Montana’s portion of Yellowstone to the District of Montana too.    So Kalt set about trying to get Congress to do just that. Nine years later, the Idaho loophole persists. And it wasn’t because Congress just didn’t hear about it; several members became aware of the loophole. Here’s the story of how Congress managed to leave a 50 square mile Zone of Death standing despite it being known for nearly a decade.    Reaching out    CJ Box’s Free Fire, whose central murder is inspired by Kalt’s article. Image via Amazon. com  According to Kalt’s 2008   article ”Tabloid Constitutionalism: How a Bill Doesn’t Become Law,” he alerted the Department of Justice, the US Attorney for Wyoming, and the House and Senate Judiciary Committees of the loophole a year before publishing the piece, in hopes that it could be closed before publication, on the off chance the article might drive people to try to commit crimes in Yellowstone. He got a reply from the US Attorney noting it wasn’t in his power to change the law, and another from an intern at the House Judiciary Committee, but nothing came of it. The article’s release and subsequent press blitz didn’t accomplish anything either.   Larry Craig ( ) promised to look into the issue but did not do anything beyond that. Rep. Mike Simpson ( ) who’s still in office, stated through a spokesperson that he didn’t think the Zone of Death was a problem, and argued we could ”count on ’checks and balances’ to remedy the issue, should a murder be committed,” a response which betrays a marked lack of understand of what the term ”checks and balances” actually refers to.    In spring 2007, Box’s novel was released. This is when Kalt finally managed to get some traction. Senator Mike Enzi ( ) a fan of Box’s work, asked the Department of Justice to look into the issue. They did, and concluded that no fix was needed. The legal argument offered was that trying someone in the wrong state or district amounts to a ”harmless error”; both Kalt and Enzi thought this was clearly wrong, as the ”error” in question is a clear violation of one’s Sixth Amendment right to a trial in the state and district where the crime allegedly occurred, and so could hardly be judged ”harmless.” But another point DOJ made was more consequential. ”Splitting Yellowstone into the district courts for Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana would also split it between the Ninth and Tenth Circuits,” Kalt writes. ”Senator Enzi and others were wary of this because it would create a new and unwelcome burden if environmentalists could use this foothold to challenge the Park Service’s management decisions in the liberal and quirky Ninth Circuit.” Whatever you think about the idea that keeping environmental cases out of a liberal court is worth leaving the Zone of Death in place, it just isn’t true that fixing the loophole would necessarily allow   for appeals about Yellowstone. As Kalt writes, ”There is nothing to preclude Congress from designating the Tenth Circuit as the proper venue for all administrative appeals concerning Yellowstone National Park.” officials are too busy working on more important issues to eliminate the Zone of Death    After the   article came out, Senator Mike Lee ( ) was elected, which, for personal reasons, made Kalt optimistic about a fix again. ”I knew Mike when we were associates together at the same law firm in DC,” Kalt says. ”Not only did he get elected to the Senate on a platform of taking the Constitution seriously, he got assigned to the very subcommittee that would be in charge of fixing this. But he has been otherwise occupied.” That’s the basic story so far: officials are too busy working on more important issues to eliminate the Zone of Death. ”They have lots of more important things to worry about,” Kalt says. ”Of course, they aren’t fixing those things either, but I need to be realistic here.” An actual case After Box’s novel was released, as Kalt was working with Enzi on a potential fix, the loophole actually became a live issue for the first time. Michael Belderrain, who had illegally shot an elk in Montana in December 2005, cited Kalt’s article in his own defense in July 2007. Belderrain was standing in Yellowstone when he fired the shot, and dragged the elk’s head to a truck parked in Yellowstone, so he was indicted in the US District Court for the District of Wyoming. He objected that he had a right to be tried by jurors from the Montana portion of the park. That’s actually somewhat possible, as the Montana part of Yellowstone is inhabited, but there are few enough residents that a trial would be difficult. Rather than try to call such a jury or present an argument for why the Sixth Amendment did not entitle Belderrain to such a trial, the court dismissed the argument out of hand, precisely because it would imply that Yellowstone contains a Zone of Death. There were three problems with this. First, as Kalt notes, Congress implies there’s a Zone of Death, not the attorney making the point in court. Second, the ruling was about Montana, in which there wouldn’t be a Zone of Death even if the court accepted Belderrain’s reasoning due to people living in the Montana portion of Yellowstone. Third, the court flagrantly ignored Article III of the Constitution’s separate right to a trial in the state of the crime by not moving the trial to Montana. So surely Belderrain would appeal, right, and get the courts to take a stand on the issue once and for all? Nope. He took a plea deal which included a provision barring him from appealing this precise issue to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. He could appeal other issues, but not this one. So the only precedent we have on the Zone of Death is a district court ruling which appears badly flawed. the loophole looms, waiting for a murderer to exploit it    ”That bothers me more than the inaction from Congress, because they had a golden opportunity to let this be resolved,” Kalt says. ”Maybe the Tenth Circuit would have said I was wrong. That would have ended things. Maybe they would have said I was right. That would have spurred Congress to fix this, something that would have only taken them a few simple lines of legislation to do. Either way, it would have been fixed in a relatively   case. Instead, the loophole looms, waiting for a murderer to exploit it. I feel like I’ve done what I can to prevent this; the blood will be on the government’s hands.” Can we fix it now? I reached out to Idaho’s current Congressional delegation to see how they felt about there being a Zone of Death in their state, and what they’d be willing to do to fix it. Lindsay Nothern, communications director for Senator Michael Crapo ( ) says the delegation has expressed an interest in resolving the issue but hasn’t received cooperation from the relevant executive branch agencies. ”Congressionals have asked legal and agency personnel for advice on legislative language but I am told none has been forthcoming and the issue stands unresolved,” Nothern writes in an email. For his part, Kalt says the following draft language should work, leaving aside complications about the Ninth Circuit:  SEC. 1 Section 131 of title 28, United States Code, is amended by striking out ”and those portions of Yellowstone National Park situated in Montana and Idaho constitute” and inserting in lieu thereof ”constitutes”. SEC. 2 Section 92 of title 28, United States Code, is amended by striking out ” exclusive of Yellowstone National Park,”. SEC. 3 Section 106 of title 28, United States Code, is amended by striking out ” exclusive of Yellowstone National Park,”.  Suzanne Wrasse, press secretary for Senator Jim Risch ( ) said the Senator was not previously aware of the loophole, but was not overly concerned as ”that area is incredibly small and has an extremely low crime rate” and the existence of the Zone ”shouldn’t stop state prosecution  —   they have dual jurisdiction in that area.” Kalt disputes the latter point. ”Senator Risch is badly mistaken,” he says. ”The state cannot prosecute a crime committed entirely in the park.” When the states containing Yellowstone were admitted to the Union, they ceded jurisdiction over the park. To quote the US code: ”The Yellowstone National Park, as its boundaries now are defined, or as they may be hereafter defined or extended, shall be under the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.” As of this post’s publication, neither Rep. Simpson nor Rep. Raúl Labrador ( ) had replied with a comment. 
Why Does Thailand Have So Many Coups?	2014-05-22	2014	5	Thailand has a beloved king. The country has had one of the more prosperous economies in Asia. It’s a magnet for Western tourists. Its history is largely peaceful. By most measures, Thailand has been very successful. So why has the country now had a dozen coups, plus many more attempted coups, since it ended its absolute monarchy and became a constitutional monarchy in 1932? The country is so   that this week’s military takeover marked the second time in eight years the armed forces have ousted a leader from the same family. Deposed Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra suffered the same fate as her brother, Thaksin Shinawatra, who was overthrown in 2006. Both are considered political outsiders who aren’t part of the traditional elite who dominate in Bangkok and other southern parts of the country. The brother and sister built support with populist appeals to the poorer and more rural Thais in the north of the country. Their rise was seen as a threat to many powerful, entrenched interests, including the military. But this addresses only the most recent coups. There are websites that debate exactly how many actual and attempted coups Thailand has had. Answer: somewhere between 20 and 30. A Strong Role For The Military, The country might have been subjected to even more if not for the fact that the military has ruled for extended periods. For example, the military took over from a civilian government in 1947 and remained in power until 1973. Thailand’s propensity for coups stems largely from the fact that the military has always played a leading role in politics, and democracy has never really taken root. When Gen. Prayuth   declared martial law on Tuesday, he cited the Martial Law Act of 1914 that gives the armed forces ”superior power” during times of crisis. The military also claimed Tuesday that this was not a coup, a pronouncement greeted with instant skepticism. Sure enough, a coup came two days later. The military argues that in this case, as in the past, it is acting within Thai law and tradition. The military claims the goal is to restore stability and not to take the country in a radically different direction. However, many critics disagree, saying the military simply wanted to get rid of a leader it could not tolerate. The army intervened this time after six months of political gridlock and street protests involving supporters and opponents of Yingluck. Coups With Distinctive Traits, The very notion of a coup tends to bring to mind a weak, impoverished, dysfunctional state. Many African nations and Latin American countries were plagued by coups in years past. And military takeovers can sometimes involve deep ideological struggles, with a   military forcing out a   leader. Yet in Thailand, these general features tend not to hold. Rather, Thai coups seem to have their own distinctive traits. The king is a stabilizing force: No matter how much Thai politicians quarrel among themselves, or with the military, no one criticizes King Bhumibol Adulyadej. His elevated status has allowed him to largely stand above the fray and encourage rival factions to work out their differences. But the king is now 86 and frail. His son, the crown prince, is much less popular, raising questions about what role the monarchy will play this time and in the future. They are usually bloodless: As with many previous coups, this takeover occurred without a shot being fired. The military is by far the most powerful force in the country and can seize power without any serious challenge. Thailand’s unrest this time has not escalated to the level of widespread violence, let alone civil war. There have, however, been some notable exceptions. The most recent was in 2010, when troops opened fire on Thaksin supporters who had been occupying Bangkok’s commercial center and refused to leave. When it was over, dozens were dead. The military hands back power: The Thai military does many of the usual things that armies do when they seize power. It bans or restricts public gatherings, carries out searches and detains suspects. Television channels were cut off Wednesday, except for a screen shot that included a clunky English translation from the ”National Peace and Order Maintaining Council.” The expectation is that the military will call the shots until it feels the country is ready for civilian politicians to take over again. But this time, as in the past, no one knows exactly when that will be. Greg Myre is the international editor for NPR. org. You can follow him @gregmyre1
A viewer’s guide to the 2016 National Spelling Bee	2014-05-27	2014	5	 This week, one of the most brutal competitions known to man begins. It’s time for the 2016 Scripps National Spelling Bee. Dreams will be broken, kids will be crushed, and when these competitors strike out, the words that tripped them up will be burned into their brains for the rest of their lives.    When the dust settles, one speller out of 285 will rise and be crowned the   kid in the nation. From the favorites to the underdogs to some of the Bee’s most notable moments, here’s your guide to this year’s competition. What you’re not seeing on television            (Brendan  ) The kids you’re seeing Wednesday and Thursday aren’t the only kids in the Bee. Many of the Bee’s 285 spellers, who have already accomplished a lot in beating out the smart kids in their schools and districts, are cut and culled in what’s known as the ”preliminaries,” which actually began Tuesday.   Related ”A bloodbath in the crying room”: Inside the vicious, brutal competition that is the National Spelling Bee    The ”preliminaries” consist of both onstage spelling and a computer test with 26   questions, split into four sections. The first section is about vocabulary and the second about spelling; each has 12 questions worth one point. After that, there are two unique   vocabulary questions worth three points each.    There are also two preliminary rounds of onstage spelling. There, a correct word is worth three points  —   and an incorrect word means a speller is eliminated.    After the preliminary section wraps up, the 50 spellers with the most points advance to the semifinals, where they complete another   test Wednesday evening and onstage spelling during the day Thursday. The 12 spellers who come out of the semifinals with the highest scores advance to the championship finals (which air in primetime on ESPN).    What spellers are asking           (Tribune News Service) After spellers get through that gauntlet of tests and waiting, they move on to the glory that is the Championship Finals  —   an oral   where, by the luck of the draw, spellers can get a cupcake or a word that might send them to their doom. This, of course, is what we’ll see on Thursday night’s broadcast. Like any sport, the actual action  —   in this case, the spelling  —   is just a small portion of the broadcast. The rest of the time is largely taken up by spellers asking for clues. Spellers are allowed to ask for: 1) alternate pronunciations, 2) a definition, 3) a part of speech, 4) language of origin, 5) for the word to be used in a sentence, and 6) for the word to be pronounced again. They’re also allowed to ask if the root word is in the dictionary, so long as they can pronounce that root word correctly, define it, and identify its language of origin.    The answers provide valuable hints, allowing contestants to, for example, rule out homonyms, identify potential spelling patterns based on the language or origin, or use the definition to guess potential roots and glean likely spellings from there. Spellers have two minutes, starting when the pronouncer finishes saying the word, to ask any or all of these questions and spell out the correct word. How the words are chosen The words all come from Webster’s Third New International Dictionary. That’s the final authority. Figuring out whether ”schizaffin” is tougher than ”isagoge” is up to a panel of Bee officials, who rate each word on a scale of 1 to 5 during organizational meetings, NPR reported in 2005. But difficulty is, of course, relative. Someone who loves Latin is going to prefer different words than a speller who studies French. Here is a list of misspelled words from the 2013 Bee, and here’s a list of the winning words dating all the way back to 1925. How spellers are eliminated            (Alex   News Images) Obviously, spelling. Any misspelling will earn that dreaded ding from the judges. And spellers will need to be on their game. The excuse of not hearing the word correctly doesn’t cut it at the Bee. ”It is sometimes impossible to detect a misunderstanding until a spelling error has been made, and the judges are not responsible for the speller’s misunderstanding,” the rule book states. If you dig deeper into the rules, spellers can also be eliminated for ”unsportsmanlike conduct” or if they fail to approach the microphone. But perhaps the most pertinent rule, and one that comes up more often than unsportsmanlike conduct or muttering things into a microphone, is that once spellers start a word, they can’t change the sequence of the letters they spelled.    We learned from Akshay Buddiga in 2004 that you cannot be eliminated for fainting during the Bee:     Nor will you get eliminated for doing a Napoleon Dynamite impersonation:        If you want a deep cut or like musicals, the rules were perfectly encapsulated by the musical The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee:   Whom to keep your eye on: The year’s competition will be intense. There’s a mix of returning vets, three siblings of previous winners, and even a   student who will make for some good television. Here are the students we will be keeping an eye on: The favorite: Tejas Muthusamy, a. k. a. Speller Number 259, knows the Spelling Bee. He took eighth place in 2014 and seventh in 2015. Tejas arguably has some of the most diverse interests of any Spelling Bee contestant or middle school student. He is arguably a   person than you. His biography, for example, includes these excellent sentences:  Tejas is a fan of the band Twenty One Pilots, but he’s equally likely to rock out to songs like ”Uma Thurman” by Fall Out Boy. Another hobby of his is reading, and his book of choice is Around the World in Eighty Days by Jules Verne. Tejas enjoys both journalism and politics, and he is happiest when at the juncture of the two.       Tejas is in eighth grade, which means this is the last year he can compete in the Bee. Now or never, Tejas. The dark horse: Snehaa Ganesh Kumar is the contestant Tejas needs to keep an eye on. She tied for fourth in 2015, after misspelling the word ”oflag” (a word that describes a war prison for officers  —   obviously  —   she spelled it ”auflahg. ”) Snehaa is relatively new to the national spelling circuit; last year was her debut at the Scripps Bee. (There are other competitors in 2016 who will be making their fourth consecutive appearance.) This year we’ll learn whether Snehaa’s success was a   fluke or if the middle school student from Sacramento has staying power.  The Dynasty: Jairam Hathwar comes from a winning bloodline. His brother, Sriram Hathwar, was the   in 2014. This isn’t Jairam’s first rodeo  —   he placed 22nd in last year’s Spelling Bee. He’ll have to improve his standing this year to do the Hathwar name proud.  The baby: Akash Vukoti is the only   student in the competition. He is basically a zygote with a dictionary. He can probably spell better than you. His favorite word is one you have literally never heard of.  Ready for it? Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis. Yes, it’s real. No, Akash is not kidding. We made a video about him, which you can watch below.      How do I watch the 2016 Scripps National Spelling Bee?  The finals are on ESPN on Thursday at 8 pm   Central. The semifinals will be shown on ESPN2 on Thursday at 10 am EDT. The preliminaries will be shown on ESPN3 on Wednesday at 8 am EDT and 1:15 pm EDT. Another way to keep up with the Bee is through social media. You can find the Instagram feed here. 
Department of Veterans Affairs Fast Facts	2014-05-30	2014	5	 (CNN) Here is a look at the US Department of Veterans Affairs. Facts:There are 18. 8 million veterans in the United States, according to the most recent statistics from the US Census. President Barack Obama has requested an appropriation of $182. 3 billion for the Department of Veterans Affairs in the 2017 Budget.  Among VA operations are 1, 221 outpatient sites, 144 hospitals and 300 Vet Centers.  The VA served 5. 9 million people in 2015, according to a VA summary of expenditures by state.  Timeline:1789   The new US government passes legislation ensuring pensions for disabled Revolutionary War veterans. 1812   The Naval Home, a facility for disabled veterans, opens in Philadelphia.  1833   Congress establishes the Bureau of Pensions to assist veterans.  1862   During the Civil War, Congress passes a bill allowing the president to purchase land for national cemeteries. Between 1865 and 1870, 70 national cemeteries open for burial of Union soldiers.  1865   At the end of the US Civil War, there are 1. 9 million Union veterans. Congress authorizes the National Asylum of Disabled Volunteer Soldiers, a system of residences for disabled and indigent veterans.  1912   Congress passes the Sherwood Act, guaranteeing pensions for Union veterans of the Civil War and veterans of the   War, regardless of their health.  1924   Congress passes the World War Adjustment Compensation Act, a system of bonuses for veterans of World War I. Any veteran entitled to more than $50 is given a certificate payable 20 years in the future and worth about $1, 500.  July 21, 1930   President Herbert Hoover signs an executive order consolidating the Veterans’ Bureau, the Bureau of Pensions and the National Homes for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers into the Veterans Administration. The VA has a budget of $786 million and serves 4. 6 million veterans.      The VA builds 27 new hospitals, bringing the total to 91. 1932   During the Great Depression, thousands of World War I veterans march on Washington, DC, to demand payment of their bonuses. After the marchers are forcibly removed, the VA pays their transportation costs home. Congress authorizes early payment of the bonuses in 1936. 1933   The VA establishes the Board of Veterans’ Appeals.  June 22, 1944   During World War II, President Franklin Roosevelt signs into law the Servicemen’s Readjustment Act, also known as the ”G. I. Bill of Rights,” a package of education benefits, federally guaranteed loans, and unemployment compensation.  1945   At the end of World War II, there are approximately 15 million veterans in the United States, and all 97 VA hospitals are filled to capacity. In response, the VA opens 54 new hospitals over the next five years.  1958   Congress pardons Confederate service members and extends benefits to the one remaining survivor. 1973   The VA takes over the administration of the National Cemetery System, with the exception of Arlington National Cemetery and the Soldier’s Home National Cemetery.  1979   Congress orders the VA to study the effects on veterans of the Agent Orange defoliant used in Vietnam. 1983   The Agent Orange study is transferred to the Centers for Disease Control.   1984   President Ronald Reagan signs a bill requiring the VA to pay benefits to Vietnam veterans suffering from chloracne or porphyria cutanea tarda, possibly caused by Agent Orange exposure.  1988   The US Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims is founded. It gives those who served in the military a chance to challenge individual decisions made by the Department of Veterans Affairs. March 15, 1989   President Reagan signs legislation elevating the Veterans Administration to Cabinet status, and renaming it the Department of Veterans Affairs.  1991   President George H. W. Bush signs into law a bill compensating Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange and suffering from  ’ lymphoma or soft tissue sarcoma.  March 1991   The VA orders Veterans Affairs Medical Center, in North Chicago, to stop performing vascular and orthopedic surgeries after the deaths of more than 40 patients in 1989 and 1990. After a review of the cases, the VA accepts responsibility for the deaths of eight patients. 1996   President Bill Clinton orders the VA to provide benefits to Vietnam veterans who develop prostate cancer or peripheral neuropathy after a National Academy of Sciences suggests there is a link between those diseases and Agent Orange exposure.  2006   Two teens steal a laptop computer and external hard drive containing the personal information of approximately 26 million veterans from the home of a VA data analyst. The laptop and hard drive are later recovered and FBI testing suggests that the data was never accessed. In 2009, the VA pays $20 million to settle a class action lawsuit brought by veterans.  February 2009   The VA notifies more than 6, 000 patients who went to Alvin C. York VA Medical Center in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, that they may have been exposed to infectious diseases at the clinic due to contaminated endoscopic equipment.  February 2009   The Charlie Norwood VA Medical Center in Augusta, Georgia, notifies more than 1, 200 people that they may have been treated with contaminated equipment.  March 2009   The VA sends letters to more than 3, 000 people who may have had colonoscopies at VA facilities in Miami, warning that they may have been exposed to hepatitis and HIV. According to hospital officials, a review of safety procedures found that tubing used in endoscope procedures was rinsed but not disinfected. 2010   The VA notifies more than 1, 800 veterans treated at the John Cochran VA hospital in St. Louis that they may have been exposed to infectious diseases during dental procedures.  July 2010   The VA unveils new regulations making it easier for men and women who served in the armed forces to receive benefits for   stress disorder. Under the new rules a veteran only needs to demonstrate that he or she served in a war and performed a job during which events could have happened that could cause the disorder. November 2010   The VA announces that it will cover disability compensation for an additional three diseases linked to Agent Orange exposure among Vietnam veterans. They are hairy cell leukemia, Parkinson’s disease and ischemic heart disease. 2011   Nine Ohio veterans test positive for hepatitis after routine dental work at a VA clinic in Dayton, Ohio. A dentist at the VA medical center there acknowledged not washing his hands or even changing gloves between patients for 18 years. February   2012   An outbreak of Legionnaires’ Disease at VA facilities in Pennsylvania kills at least six veterans.  November 2013   A CNN investigation shows that veterans are dying because of long waits and delayed care at US veterans hospitals. The VA has confirmed six deaths tied to delays at  the Williams Jennings Bryan Dorn Veterans Medical Center in Columbia, South Carolina.  January 30, 2014   CNN reports that at least 19 veterans have died because of delays in simple medical screenings like colonoscopies or endoscopies, at various VA hospitals or clinics. This is according to an internal document from the US Department of Veterans Affairs, obtained exclusively by CNN, that deals with patients diagnosed with cancer in 2010 and 2011. April 2014   Retired VA physician Dr. Sam Foote tells CNN that the Phoenix Veterans Affairs Health Care system maintained a secret list of patient appointments, designed to hide the fact that patients were waiting months to be seen. At least 40 patients died while waiting for appointments, according to Foote, though it is not clear they were all on secret lists. May 9, 2014   The scheduling scandal widens as a Cheyenne, Wyoming, VA employee is placed on administrative leave after an email surfaces in which the employee discusses ”gaming the system a bit” to manipulate waiting times. The suspension comes a day after a scheduling clerk in San Antonio admitted to ”cooking the books” to shorten apparent waiting times. Three days later, two employees in Durham, North Carolina, are placed on leave over similar allegations. May 20, 2014   The VA’s Office of the Inspector General announces it is investigating 26 agency facilities for allegations of doctored waiting times. May 28, 2014   A preliminary report by the VA’s inspector general indicates at least 1, 700 veterans waiting to see a doctor were never scheduled for an appointment and were never placed on a wait list at the Veterans Affairs medical center in Phoenix. May 30, 2014   VA Secretary Eric Shinseki resigns.  June 9, 2014   The Department of Veterans Affairs releases the results of an internal audit of hundreds of Veterans Affairs facilities. It reveals that 63, 869 veterans enrolled in the VA health care system in the past 10 years have yet to be seen for an appointment. June 23, 2014   In a scathing letter and report sent to the White House, the US Office of Special Counsel (OSC) expresses concern that the VA hasn’t adequately addressed whistleblower complaints of wrongdoing. The report also slams the VA’s medical review agency, the Office of the Medical Inspector (OMI) for its refusal to admit that lapses in care have affected veterans’ health. June 24, 2014   A report issued by Sen. Tom Coburn’s office finds that more than 1, 000 veterans may have died in the last decade because of malpractice or lack of care from VA medical centers. June 24, 2014   Pauline DeWenter, a scheduling clerk at the Phoenix VA, tells CNN that records of dead veterans were changed or physically altered, some even in recent weeks, to hide how many people died while waiting for care at the Phoenix VA hospital. July 29, 2014   The US Senate confirms Robert McDonald as the new Veterans Affairs secretary. July 31, 2014   The Senate approves a $16 billion bill to overhaul the Department of Veterans Affairs.  August 7, 2014   President Obama signs into law the $16 billion bill, providing money to build more VA medical facilities and hire more doctors and nurses. August 26, 2014   The VA office of the Inspector General releases a report on delays at the Phoenix VA health care system. The study looked at more than 3, 000 cases and found that dozens of veterans had ”clinically significant” delays in care, and six of them died. The report says investigators could not conclusively link their deaths to those delays. September 17, 2014   In a hearing before the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, Acting Inspector General Richard Griffin reverses his opinion. Griffin says that long wait times at VA health care facilities in Phoenix did contribute to a number of veterans’ deaths. November 10, 2014   VA Secretary Robert McDonald announces the VA has taken ”disciplinary action” against 5, 600 employees in the last year, and he said more firings will soon follow. Beyond sacking officials that don’t meet the VA’s values, McDonald says the reforms will include the establishment of a   customer service office to understand and respond to veteran needs, new partnerships with private organizations and other reorganizations to simplify the department’s structure. November 13, 2014   The VA announces it has fired Terry Gerigk Wolf, the director of the Pittsburgh VA Healthcare System, for ”conduct unbecoming of a senior executive and wasteful spending.” An outbreak of Legionnaire’s disease in 2011 and 2012 killed six veterans at the facility.  November 24, 2014   Sharon Helman, the head of the Phoenix VA, is fired. She was put on administrative leave following a CNN interview in April, in which she denied the existence of a secret list used to cover up delays in patient care. December 15, 2014   The VA Inspector General releases a report that indicates a VA fact sheet contained misleading information, overstating the scope of its review of unresolved cases. The VA claimed that it reviewed cases dating back to 1999 but it only examined cases dating back to 2007, according to the report. The inspector general also questions how the VA resolved an issue with delayed appointments. The VA reported that it reduced the number of appointments delayed more than 90 days, from 2 million to 300, 000, but did not provide paperwork detailing whether the appointments were canceled or if the patients received treatment, according to the inspector general.      March 10, 2015   CNN reports that more than 1, 600 veterans waited between 60 and 90 days for appointments at facilities operated by the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System. About 400 veterans waited six months for an appointment, according to documents provided to CNN. The average wait time, according to documents dated January 15, 2015, was 48 days. September 2, 2015   The VA Inspector General releases a review of alleged mismanagement at the VA’s Health Eligibility Center. According to the review, more than 307, 000 deceased veterans were listed as enrollees with pending VA applications. The inspector general calculated that about 35% of all pending records were for deceased veterans. CNN reports that many of the deceased veterans may have died while awaiting treatment. 
Do Female-Named Hurricanes Need To Lean In?	2014-06-03	2014	6	We were alarmed to learn yesterday that hurricanes with female names are not being taken as seriously as their male counterparts. It seems people in the path of a hurricane are more likely to heed warnings to take shelter or evacuate if the storm is named Charley than if the storm is named Eloise. Which can be a deadly decision. [Because, seriously: Hurricanes are dangerous  —   even if they have ”lady” names. If authorities tell you to take shelter or evacuate, do it. Right away.] That said, with female hurricanes now making up 50 percent of the cyclone workforce and advice for women on doing things better making up at least 50 percent of the Internet* we’re also worried about what this trend means for the career advancement of female storms. We’ve seen this before. We know where this is going. So to get ahead of the curve, we’d like to offer some advice to all the girls out there hoping to become fearsome natural disasters when they grow up. Stop acting so ”blustery”: What’s with all these   winds? Why are you blowing things out of proportion? We know the hurricane season is in touch with the phases of the moon, if you know what we are saying, but for heaven’s sake, keep it together. Be confident: When you slam into a coast, do it like you mean it. Don’t end your sentences with question marks  —   if you tell your boss you’re going to erode a coastline, say, ”I’m going to erode this coastline, PERIOD.” Be calm, and make eye contact: Eye of the storm, baby. Eye of the storm. Don’t let issues at home distract you: If El Niño calls while you are in a meeting, have your assistant tell him that Mommy’s busy, and you’ll call him back just as soon as you make landfall. Network: Surround yourself with strong female tropical storms and typhoons. Look around and ask yourself: Who is wreaking the kind of havoc that I would like to wreak? Find those storms and forge a sisterhood. Negotiate: If you know that you are a Category 5, why settle for being classified as a Category 3? Don’t sell yourself short. Don’t be intimidated by men in the workplace: Who’s this guy NOAA? And why is he keeping tabs on you? That’s creepy. Report him to HR. Have a   plan: No meteorologist is going to respect a hurricane that can’t stay on track. Find a seaboard and stick to it. Never, ever cry in the office: Save the waterworks for the storm surge, ladies. Remember, the sky’s the limit: Literally. You’re a hurricane. In the sky. Now act like it. Don’t be held back by the glass ceiling: You’re going to let a glass ceiling hold you back?! A GLASS CEILING? You’re a hurricane, for crying out loud. Just shatter it! [Note: A more complete version of our advice will appear in our upcoming magazine article ”Raining Really Hard: You’re Doing It Wrong.” Look for the cover, where a harried woman in a rumpled suit blows her bangs out of her eyes while balancing a diapered baby Photoshopped with the head of the Weather Channel’s Jim Cantore on her right hip while holding a palm frond in her left hand.] *An estimate. And probably conservative.

Live to 100: Number of centenarians has doubled	2014-06-04	2014	6	 (CNN) It is Her Majesty’s custom to send a personal greeting to her subjects on their 100th birthdays. These days the Queen of England has a lot more letters to write. That’s because a record number of people are living to 100 and beyond in the United Kingdom    and worldwide. In fact,   of babies born in the UK in 2013 are expected to live to 100, according to their Office for National Statistics. In the United States, the population has seen similar trends. As this centenarian population grows, scientists want a better understanding of how and why those people do eventually die.   A new study finds that these 100+ types are more likely to have ”old age” listed as their cause of death than chronic diseases, according to lead author Dr. Catherine Evans.   How to live to 100, The study, published in the most recent edition of PLOS Medicine, finds that most centenarians die from pneumonia or general frailty rather than cancer or heart disease. Chronic diseases are more likely to kill people who only make it to their 80s and 90s.   To get at this information, Evans examined data from the death records of people in the United Kingdom who died between 2001 and 2010. She looked at a group of 35, 867 people who were between 100 and 115 when they died. The median age of death was 101.  Evans said she was surprised at how large that 100+ population is. It has nearly doubled every decade since the 1950s in the UK. Globally the 100+ population is projected to grow to about 18 million people by the end of the century.    Looking at where these centenarians died showed that the majority ended their days in a care home (61%) or hospital (27%). They were less likely to die at home (10%) or in hospice care (0. 2%). Earlier studies show the elderly prefer to die at home, so the study authors argue that as this population grows there is an ”urgent need to ensure adequate   care and responsive community care services to support people living with extreme longevity in these care settings.”   Dr. Sanjay Gupta: Chasing Life, Since the elderly are often frail, earlier studies have shown that ”home” isn’t necessarily about the brick and mortar where a person’s family lived. Home, Evans suggests, may be more of a ”metaphor for where you feel safe and secure, and where your loved ones are nearby.”    While this study specifically looked at the British population, the number of centenarians has grown all around the world.  Dr. Ronald D. Adelman, who works with many of these   people as the medical director of the Weill Cornell Wright Center on Aging, said that the study is an important tool to understand a population that’s often overlooked. ”When it comes to the elderly there are really three groups we look at,” explained Adelman. ”Those who are considered old, who are 65 to 74 years of age the older, between ages 75 to 84 and the   which are those people over the age of 85.  ”But when you look at centenarians, that really is an expanding group, and the important thing is to get their advance directives, to make sure these people express how they want to be treated in their later years, so they can live a better quality of life and be more comfortable. Where do they want to live, how do they want to live and what’s best for them?” Eat nuts, live longer, Because of advances made in medical technology, and the fact many people entering their golden years are more   than ever before, Adelman says it’s time society takes the elderly, including centenarians, seriously because this older age group will continue to grow and need care. ”To be honest, 65 is no longer old,” noted Adelman. ”Ten thousand Americans are turning 65 every day. There are 77 million baby boomers, who were born between 1946 and 1964. They are more educated, they have the best health literacy than prior generations, they exercise, they eat right and they are living longer, healthier lives.  ”We need to be able to provide them the best care and services possible, as they age into their 80s, 90s and beyond.” Who will live to 100?

Boko Haram Fast Facts	2014-06-09	2014	6	 (CNN) Here’s a look at Boko Haram, a militant Islamic group working out of Nigeria, whose purpose is to institute Sharia, or Islamic law.   Facts:In the local Hausa dialect, Boko Haram means ”Western education is forbidden.” The group also refers to itself as Jama’atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda’awati   meaning ”People Committed to the Propagation of the Prophet’s Teachings and Jihad.” Boko Haram militants mainly inhabit areas in the northern states of Nigeria, specifically Yobe, Kano, Bauchi, Borno and Kaduna.  Originally, Boko Haram was referred to locally as the Nigerian Taliban because of their religious similarities to the Taliban. Boko Haram does not engage in Nigeria’s political system out of an adherence to a fundamentalist form of Islam, which forbids participation unless the system is based on Sharia, or Islamic law.   Timeline:2002   The group, which may have existed since the late 1990s, organizes under the Muslim cleric Mohammed Yusuf. It is centered in Maiduguri, the capital of the northeastern state of Borno.  December 2003   The first known attack by Boko Haram includes roughly 200 militants, who attack multiple police stations in the state of Yobe, near the Niger border. July 2009   The Boko Haram uprising begins in Bauchi and spreads to the states of Borno, Kano and Yobe. The militant group kills scores of police officers. A joint military task force responds, leaving more than 700 Boko Haram members dead and its operational mosque destroyed. The uprising ends when police capture the group’s leader, Mohammed Yusuf. His deputy, Abubakar Shekau, reportedly dies in the uprising. Yusuf later dies in police custody police say he is shot during an attempted escape, but Boko Haram claims it is an extrajudicial execution.   July 2010   Boko Haram releases a video statement in which Yusuf’s deputy who allegedly died the previous year, Abubakar Shekau, claims to be the leader of the group. September 7, 2010   In the state of Bauchi, 50 Boko Haram militants attack a prison, killing five people and releasing more than 700 inmates. May 29, 2011   The day of President Goodluck Jonathan’s inauguration, Boko Haram detonates three IEDs near a military barracks in the city of Bauchi in Bauchi State. At least 10 people die in the attack.  August 25, 2011   Twelve people die after Boko Haram militants attack a police station and two banks in the city of Gombi in Adamawa.  August 26, 2011   Boko Haram attacks the United Nations compound in Abuja. A car bomb kills 23 people and injures more than 75 others. November 4, 2011   More than 100 die in multiple attacks in Yobo, Damaturu and Borno states. Boko Haram militants utilize IEDs and   IEDs to target security forces and their offices, markets and 11 churches.  January 2012   A newly formed splinter group, known as Ansaru, announces Abu Usmatul   as its leader.  January 20, 2012   More than 200 people are killed when Boko Haram launches coordinated attacks targeting police, military, a prison and other targets in the city of Kano in Kano State. August 23, 2012   Unverified media reports claim that Boko Haram has begun peace talks with the Nigerian government. Boko Haram spokesman Abu Qa Qa warns the media against making any more claims, ”We are telling the government to understand that if it is not ready to embrace Sharia and the Quran as the guiding book from which the laws of the land derive, there shall be no peace. .. [and media agencies] should understand that for us there is no difference between those fighting with guns and with the pen.” February 19, 2013   Militants alleging to be Boko Haram kidnap a French family of seven in a national park in northern Cameroon however, the affiliation with Boko Haram cannot be verified. The family is later released.  April 2013   President Goodluck Jonathan states he has appointed a team to explore the possibility of amnesty for Islamist militants. Shekau responds in an audio statement: ”Surprisingly the Nigerian government is talking about granting us amnesty. What wrong have we done? On the contrary, it is we that should grant you pardon.” April 19, 2013   Boko Haram battles with multinational security forces from Niger, Nigeria and Chad in the city of Baga in Borno State, leaving nearly 200 people dead, including many civilians. Shekau releases a video in May saying Boko Haram is not responsible for the civilian deaths.  May 15, 2013   Nigeria’s Ministry of Defence announces a military offensive has begun in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe to ”rid the nation’s border territories of terrorist bases and activities.” June 4, 2013   President Jonathan approves the proscription of Boko Haram and splinter group Ansaru as terrorist organizations. June 2013   Boko Haram targets churches in various states on three Sundays in a row, leaving more than 50 people dead.  August 14, 2013   The Ministry of Defence announces the death of Boko Haram’s    Momodu Baba (known as Abu Saad).    August 19, 2013   Nigeria’s chief army spokesperson claims Shekau may have died after an attack on June 30, but the claim is never verified.  September 17, 2013   Boko Haram gunmen dress in military uniforms and stage a fake checkpoint near Benisheik in Borno, executing travelers and burning vehicles, leaving at least 143 people dead.  September 25, 2013   A man claiming to be Shekau appears in a video and says that he is, in fact, alive and well. However, his identity is not verified.  November 13, 2013   The US State Department adds Boko Haram and Ansaru to its list of terrorist organizations.  January 26, 2014   At least 45 are killed in a market in Kawuri in Borno after Boko Haram militants open fire.   February 11, 2014   At least 23 people are killed when suspected Boko Haram militants torch houses in the village of Konduga, according to the governor of Borno state. April 14, 2014   Boko Haram militants kidnap approximately 276 teenage girls from a boarding school in Chibok in Borno. Officials there say some of the girls were able to escape. The kidnapping sparks global outrage and a #BringBackOurGirls campaign on social media. May 5, 2014   In a video statement, a man claiming to be Shekau says, ”I abducted your girls. I will sell them in the market, by Allah. ..there is a market for selling humans. Allah says I should sell. He commands me to sell. I will sell women. I sell women.” May 13, 2014   Hundreds of Boko Haram militants storm three villages in the state of Borno. Villagers resist, killing more than 200 Boko Haram fighters.  May 20, 2014   Twin blasts in the city of Jos kill 118 people at a market. Nigerian authorities describe the blasts as ”terrorist activities” but decline to speculate on who might be responsible. May 21, 2014   The White House announces that the United States has sent 80 troops to Chad to help search for the kidnapped schoolgirls.  May 22, 2014   The UN Security Council adds Boko Haram to its sanctions list. June   2014   Hundreds of people are killed in raids by Boko Haram Islamic militants in the state of Borno, with some sources putting the death toll at 400 to 500. June   2014   Suspected Boko Haram militants kidnap at least 20 young women over a weekend in the northeastern Nigeria village of Garkin Fulani, eight kilometers from a town where more than 200 schoolgirls were taken nearly two months earlier. June   2014   Boko Haram militants hold the village of Kummabza in Borno state, northeastern Nigeria, hostage for four days. They abduct more than 60 females, including children, and kill 30 men in the raid. July 7, 2014   Sources say at least 57 girls kidnapped by Boko Haram last month from the Kummabza village in northern Borno state, have escaped from their captors and returned to their village. Boko Haram is still believed to be holding about 200 schoolgirls abducted April 14 from a boarding school in the town of Chibok. July   2014   Boko Haram raids the Nigerian town of Damboa. By the time the raid ends, 66 residents have been killed and more than 15, 000 have fled. October 16, 2014   The Nigerian government announces it has reached a ceasefire agreement with the Islamist terror group that includes the promised release of more than 200 kidnapped schoolgirls. November 1, 2014   In a video, the group’s leader denies the Nigerian government’s claim of a ceasefire. January 3, 2015   A   raid begins, where hundreds of Boko Haram gunmen seize the town of Baga and neighboring villages in northern Nigeria, as well as a multinational military base, leaving bodies scattered everywhere and as many as 2, 000 people feared dead. January   2015   At least 20 are killed and 18 injured in Maiduguri after explosives strapped to a girl are detonated at a marketplace screening checkpoint. At least three are dead and 43 injured after two suicide bombs, strapped to girls, detonate in a mobile phone market in Potiskum. Boko Haram is suspected as being behind the attacks.  March 2, 2015   Boko Haram releases a video showing the apparent beheadings of two men they suspected of being spies.  March 7, 2015   In an audio message purportedly from leader Abubakar Shekau, Boko Haram pledges allegiance to ISIS, the Islamic militant group which controls areas of Iraq and Syria, and is known for its gruesome executions.  March 12, 2015   In an audio message purportedly from an ISIS spokesman, the group announces that the caliphate has expanded to western Africa and that ISIS leader Abu Bakr   has accepted Boko Haram’s pledge of allegiance. On the same day, ISIS blows up the Iraqi army headquarters north of Ramadi, killing at least 40 Iraqi soldiers.  April   2015   The decomposed corpses of at least 400 men, women and children are found in shallow, mass graves and on the streets of Damasak in northeastern Nigeria. Due to a joint   military operation, the town has recently been freed of Boko Haram, which seized the town in November.   April   30, 2015   Nigerian troops rescue about 450 women and girls in the Sambisa Forest during a military operation centered around destroying Boko Haram camps and rescuing civilians. According to the military, none of those rescued have been identified as the Chibok schoolgirls kidnapped last April.   July 1, 2015   Boko Haram militants raid three villages in the northeastern Nigerian state of Borno, killing at least 145 people, according to witnesses. September 3, 2015   An estimated 30 people are dead and 145 injured after Boko Haram militants attack a crowded market in Kerawa, Cameroon and an infirmary near a Cameroonian military camp, according to Cameroonian military spokesman Col. Didier Badjeck. September 23, 2015   241 women and children are rescued and 43 Boko Haram militants are arrested after the Nigerian military raids camps run by the terrorist group in two villages. February 2016   Militants from Boko Haram attack two villages in northeast Nigeria, killing at least 30 people. In another attack, two female suicide bombers kill 58 people at a Nigerian refugee camp for villagers fleeing terrorism. A suspect in the attack on the camp tells officers that she and the two suicide bombers were dispatched by Boko Haram.   April 14, 2016   CNN posts a video of some of the teenage girls abducted from Chibok that was sent to negotiators by their captors as a ”proof of life.” May 17, 2016   Amina Ali Nkeki, one of more than 200 Chibok schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram, is the first to be freed after two years in captivity. Nigeria’s army says she was rescued by army troops, but a witness tells CNN the girl wandered out of the Sambisa Forest in the northeast of the country along with her child and a man. August 3, 2016   ISIS publication   says that Sheikh Abu Musab   is the new leader of Boko Haram. A Boko Haram insider confirms to CNN that   the son of the group’s founder   who was killed by Nigerian security forces in 2009   is in fact the new leader.  August 14, 2016   Boko Haram releases a video of some of the girls kidnapped in April 2014 and demands the release of Boko Haram fighters in exchange for the girls.  October 13, 2016   Boko Haram militants hand over 21 Chibok schoolgirls to authorities after a series of negotiations with the Nigerian government. It’s the first mass release of any of the more than 200 girls and women kidnapped from their school in April 2014. November 5, 2016   A Chibok schoolgirl carrying her    son is found by the Nigerian army. January 5, 2017   The Nigerian army says another missing Chibok girl and her   old baby have been located during an operation to arrest suspected Boko Haram terrorists. January 17, 2017   Scores of people are killed when a Nigerian fighter jet mistakenly bombs a camp for the internally displaced during an operation in Rann against Boko Haram militants, according to Nigerian officials and the Red Cross. The Nigerian government provides no official death toll, but humanitarian aid group Doctors Without Borders says ”about 90” people died. May 6, 2017     Chibok schoolgirls are released after negotiations between Boko Haram and the Nigerian government.

The food stamps cookbook: how to eat for $4 a day	2014-06-25	2014	6	 A person could easily spend $4 on a pint of fancy ice cream or a tiny filet of salmon at their local grocery store. But Leanne Brown set out to make a cookbook for Americans with a food budget of $4 per day. Brown’s Good and Cheap, currently the focus of a wildly successful Kickstarter campaign, aims to make good food more accessible to Americans on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, often called food stamps). Though Brown has crafted a pretty cookbook, the question is how practical this approach is.    many of brown’s dishes wouldn’t look out of place in a mark bittman column The idea of the book  —   which started as Brown’s capstone project for her master’s degree in food studies at NYU  —   is to promote the idea that poorer Americans can eat good, healthy food. That $4 figure she works off of is one common shorthand for how much SNAP recipients receive per day (though that varies by family size and income, and the program is also meant to supplement people’s food budgets). A PDF of the book is available for free here. The book more than succeeds in making   cooking look appetizing. Thanks to artful photos of cheap, fashionable vegetables like kale and broccoli rabe, many of the foods wouldn’t look out of place in a Mark Bittman column or on Martha Stewart’s website. There’s also something to be said for lending some dignity to a difficult food situation. But even though individual recipes could be entries in a foodie blog, the overall diet is rather more restrictive.    In the process of creating recipes, Brown discovered exactly which foods are luxuries. Certain types of fresh produce, for example, will be tough to buy on a SNAP budget.    ”In the summer we all really want to eat things like fresh berries and these juicy wonderful fruits, and berries are expensive,” she says. ”In general, if you’re thinking in terms of calorie density, they’re a tough choice to make.” Frugality has helped to make Brown’s recipes largely vegetarian  —   in salads and pasta dishes, chickpeas, beans, and eggs are often the protein sources of choice. Grains also feature heavily  —   one section praises toast as an inexpensive vehicle for salads and leftovers. Certain cheaper vegetables, like potatoes and eggplants, pop up often, while more expensive vegetables like avocados don’t make it in.    But is it practical to Bittmanize the food stamp budget? Other writers at Salon and the Wall Street Journal have written that it is more than doable to eat healthfully on food stamps, and the USDA also has a deluge of brochures on how to make it work. But one writer at Atlanta magazine described it perfectly earlier this year when she and her husband decided to eat on a food stamp budget for a week. ”WORKING MOTHERS CAN FOLLOW [USDA] GUIDELINES AND PREPARE   NUTRITIOUS FOODS OR CAN HAVE A PAYING JOB . .. BUT MAY FIND IT DIFFICULT TO DO BOTH”    ”[O]ur situation embodies the   scenario USDA nutritionists have in mind when they produce brochures on healthy cooking tips: We have time to cook, we have a   kitchen, and mostly importantly we have a car and thus can shop around for the good deals and quality foods,” wrote Rebecca Burns. In a 2010 paper, researchers from the University of Washington and Bastyr University found that the USDA’s Thrifty Food Plan, which is used to set SNAP benefit levels, might not be feasible for   Americans for a number of reasons. One of those is ”time poverty.” Researchers found that cooking foods on the plan often meant a   family had to spend more than the normal amount of time on kitchen prep. ”Working mothers can follow TFP guidelines and prepare   nutritious foods, or can have a paying job outside the home, but may find it difficult to do both,” they wrote. And while Brown’s cookbook is distinct from those USDA plans, one can imagine that after working long hours, persuading picky children to eat potato and kale rolls sounds unappealing. Since writing the cookbook, Brown has acknowledged the potential shortcomings of a SNAP cookbook. Already on her Kickstarter page she has responded to criticisms that the cookbook assumes users have kitchens and appliances, not to mention access to fresh vegetables.  The cover of Brown’s cookbook ”i hope [the cookbook] is helpful, but I know it’s still not going to be easy to get by on a regular basis.” Brown stresses that the point isn’t to make living on SNAP benefits look easy. The point is to make it a bit easier.     ”I hope [the cookbook] is helpful, but I know it’s still not going to be easy to get by on a regular basis,” she says. ”To really have a truly amazing diet you have to spend a lot of time in the kitchen, and I know a lot of people won’t be able to do that.”  In that sense one can see the cookbook being useful to the   (or unpaid) intern or college student, as much as it is to the typical SNAP family. A New York City resident herself, Brown also says writing the cookbook highlighted for her one more limitation of the SNAP program. ”Someone in rural Kansas has really different food issues  —   they have different access and different prices and different barriers than someone who lives in urban NYC,” says brown. ”Currently SNAP is such a nationalized program that it doesn’t address some of those regional variations very well. Certainly more research could go into that.”

Nevada sheriff says Cliven Bundy must be held accountable for standoff	2014-07-05	2014	7	 A Nevada sheriff has said that rancher Cliven Bundy must bear responsibility for actions that led to a standoff between federal agents and militia members earlier this year, but added that the federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM) must reconsider some of its methods used prior to the confrontation. Clark County Sheriff Doug Gillespie told the Las Vegas   editorial board Thursday that he had warned Bundy prior to the April standoff that any protests over the BLM’s attempt to round up more than 500 of the rancher’s cattle must be peaceful.  The BLM says that Bundy owes over $1 million in fees and penalties for trespassing on federal property without a permit over 20 years. Bundy, whose ancestors settled in the area in the late 1800s, refuses to acknowledge federal authority on public lands. A federal judge in Las Vegas first ordered Bundy in 1998 to remove ”trespass cattle” from land the bureau declared a refuge for the endangered desert tortoise. Bureau officials obtained court orders last year allowing the roundup. Milita members descended upon the ranch after a video showing one of Bundy’s sons being stunned by a Taser was circulated widely. Gillespie said that Bundy crossed the line by allowing his supporters onto his property to aim guns at law enforcement.  ”If you step over that line, there are consequences to those actions,” Gillespie said. ”And I believe they stepped over that line. No doubt about it. They need to be held accountable for it.” Gillespie blamed the BLM for escalating the conflict and ignoring his advice to delay the roundup after he had a confrontational meeting with Bundy’s children a few weeks before it began. ”I came back from that saying, `This is not the time to do this,’ ” the sheriff told the  . ”They said, `We do this all the time. We know what we’re doing. We hear what you’re saying, but we’re moving forward. ”’ Gillespie also claimed that the BLM lied to him by saying that they had a place to move Bundy’s cattle after the roundup. The sheriff said he later discovered that was not the case. The bureau backed down during the showdown with Bundy and his armed supporters, citing safety concerns, and released some 380 Bundy cattle collected during a weeklong operation from a vast arid range half the size of the state of Delaware. A statement made to the Associated Press by the BLM Saturday said the agency continues to pursue the matter ”aggressively through the legal system.” BLM spokeswoman Celia Boddington also criticized Gillespie for claiming that the agency mishandled the operation and claimed that the bureau acted in ”full coordination” with the sheriff’s office.   ”It is unfortunate that the sheriff is now attempting to rewrite the details of what occurred, including his claims that the BLM did not share accurate information,” she said. ”The sheriff encouraged the operation and promised to stand    with us as we enforced two recent federal court orders.” ”Sadly, he backed out of his commitment shortly before the operation   and after months of joint planning   leaving the BLM and the National Park Service to handle the crowd control that the sheriff previously committed to handling,” she added.

An ’Unexpected’ Treat For Octavia E. Butler Fans	2014-07-10	2014	7	When a writer passes before her time, readers and fans often mourn not only the loss of her presence in the world, but the loss of the words she may yet have written. Such was the case when, in 2006, speculative fiction writer Octavia E. Butler died unexpectedly at her home in Seattle. Butler is one of the most celebrated authors in the genre, her novels and short stories regularly graced with Hugo and Nebula awards. She was the first speculative fiction writer to receive the MacArthur ”genius grant,” a prize whose name perfectly summarizes Butler’s work: She was a genius. It’s depressing to know that there will never be another new Octavia E. Butler novel to read. However, Butler’s papers went to Huntington Library, where scholar Gerry Canavan is even now poring over them, unearthing fragments of the novels and stories she was working on. At some point during the excavation, two short stories emerged: ”A Necessary Being” and ”Childfinder.” Both written in the ’70s, one was apparently left unpublished by Butler herself, the other part of a famously unreleased anthology. Both are finally seeing the light of day in an   called Unexpected Stories. The first story, ”A Necessary Being,” is fantasy set in a world where leadership is biologically determined and leaders are utterly necessary to the proper functioning of society, even when they are unwilling and forced into it. Characters struggle with the tension between biological imperative and personal choice and freedom, a theme Butler would return to many times in later works. In sensibility, it resonates with another of Butler’s stories  —   ”Bloodchild”  —   though the plots are entirely different. In that story, a human boy struggles with his role as a future host for alien offspring  —   a role that will mean his death even as it helps ensure the comfort and survival of his loved ones. But while the young alien host has no real choices, the characters in ”A Necessary Being” seize agency at the first opportunity. ”Childfinder” is a story avid Butler fans have been waiting to see for a long time. She wrote it at the famed Clarion workshop in 1970 and sold it to her mentor, Harlan Ellison, for his anthology The Last Dangerous Visions. It was her first sale she said it made her feel like she ”was on [her] way as a writer.” Unfortunately, The Last Dangerous Visions never saw the light of day, so ”Childfinder,” like many of the stories Ellison bought, has been sitting in his possession, unpublished, for over 40 years  —   until now. The story starts out with a quote from what appears to be an anthropological or history text, speculating that psionic (i. e. telepathic) ability in humans has the potential to ”bridge   divisions of race, religion, nationality, etc. as could nothing else.” The idea that some science fictional catalyst, be it telepathy or an alien attack, will erase boundaries or eliminate prejudice is a common trope in genre literature. And you can find plenty of writers who base the foundation of their fictional worlds on this optimistic ideal. But even here as a young writer, Butler admits to a generally pessimistic outlook in ”Childfinder” there’s little hope that this   human solidarity can be achieved so easily. That’s not to say the story itself is pessimistic or hopeless  —   it’s certainly not. It’s a realistic view of the future of the human race through the eyes of a black woman in 1970s America, suffused with a quiet revolutionary spirit that perfectly suits the author’s style. There are also echoes of her Patternist series  —   novels about networked telepaths who control the human race. Perhaps ”Childfinder” was the initial seed? In both stories Butler is able to create a whole world and a whole history out of very few words, by centering them on women who suffer no illusions about the worlds and circumstances they live in. She addresses race and class   as well as in metaphorical terms. And as Walter Mosley points out in his introduction, she was doing this ”[l]ong before [she] changed the face of science and speculative fiction, the landscape of the potentials of literature.” Though all too short, Unexpected Stories offers a   glimpse into Butler’s rich writing style and her genre sensibilities as they formed. It’s a must read, not just for Butler fans but for all lovers of speculative fiction. K.

Food-Mood Connection: How You Eat Can Amp Up Or Tamp Down Stress	2014-07-14	2014	7	Eat more when you’re stressed? You’re not alone. More than a third of the participants in a national survey conducted by NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard School of Public Health said they change their diets during stressful times. And many of us are quick to turn to either sugary foods or highly refined carbohydrates such as bagels or white pasta when the stress hits. ”There can be a bit of a vicious cycle,” says David Ludwig, a professor of pediatrics and nutrition at Harvard University and a researcher at Boston Children’s Hospital. ”When we feel stressed we seek foods that are going to comfort us immediately, but often times those foods lead to surges and crashes in hormones and blood sugar that increase our susceptibility to new stresses.” Now, of course, we can’t control lots of the events and circumstances that lead to stress. But, Ludwig says, ”our body chemistry can very much affect how that stress gets to us.” He points to a study he and some colleagues published in the journal Pediatrics several years back. They gave teenage boys different types of breakfast meals. One included   eggs, while another meal included     oats. A third meal of instant oatmeal was highest on the glycemic index, a measure of how quickly sugar is absorbed and how soon a food is likely to make you hungry again. ”After the highly refined instant oatmeal, blood sugar soared but then crashed a few hours later,” Ludwig says. ”And when that happened the [stress] hormone adrenaline, or epinephrine, surged to very high levels.” Ludwig says the links between food and mood are complex. And just as there are individual differences in susceptibility to diseases, there are differences in response to food, too. Not all of us are equally sensitive to foods like instant oatmeal, high on the glycemic index. Given what we know about how different foods affect the risk of cardiovascular disease and Type 2 diabetes, ”why should it be so surprising that the nature of the foods we eat can also affect our emotional and mental  ?” Ludwig says. So, if eating lots of refined carbs and sugar may exacerbate our responses to stress, are there other types of food that make us more resilient? Researcher Joe Hibbeln of the National Institutes of Health believes the answer is yes. ”I think there’s a very strong connection between what you eat and your mood,” Hibbeln says. He has spent the past two decades investigating links between the   fatty acids found in fish and emotional health. ”One of the most basic ways that   help to regulate mood is by quieting down the [body’s] response to inflammation,” Hibbeln says. When you get walloped by something, whether it’s a virus or an emotional stressor, you want to bounce back as quickly as possible, he notes. ”You can either be good at weathering stress or you can be brittle. And   make your stress system more flexible,” Hibbeln says. He points to studies showing that   can help protect neurons against the damage that can be done by chronic stress. He also points to clinical trials that have found that   may help control depressive symptoms. And a study of schoolchildren in England linked   to more   behavior. Hibbeln knows that some people shy away from fish due to the cost, so he points to affordable options such as canned light tuna and sardines, which are good sources of  . There are also   sources of   such as flaxseed and chia seeds. Now, clearly,   aren’t the only food that’s good for our emotional health. Drew Ramsey, a psychiatrist at Columbia University and author of The Happiness Diet, says a   diet is best for beating stress. He points to his favorite   breakfast: scrambled eggs mixed with kale (or other greens) and topped with pumpkin seeds. With this meal, you’re covering all your bases, Ramsey says. The eggs are a good source of B vitamins and protein, which can be more satiating than a   breakfast. The greens are incredibly   and are a good source of vitamin A, vitamin K and potassium. And the pumpkin seeds are a good source of magnesium  —   which is thought to play a role in fending off anxiety  —   and zinc, which may help boost the immune system. For dessert, go for dark chocolate, which can have ”an acute affect on mood,” Ramsey says. He points to a study that found cocoa flavanols can help boost mood and sustain clear thinking among adults who are engaged in intense mental efforts  —   like students cramming, or journalists on deadline. In addition, dark chocolate has been shown to improve vascular health by increasing blood flow and reducing inflammation. The bottom line? The foods we choose can’t magic away stress. But Ramsey says he believes ”there is a very, very strong connection between food and mood.”

From the archive, 30 July 1994: Photojournalist Kevin Carter dies	2014-07-30	2014	7	Kevin Carter took the picture above of the three AWB members being shot during their abortive invasion of Bophuthatswana just before the South African election. It was a picture that made nearly every front page in the world, the one real photograph of the whole campaign.  Carter ran out of film halfway through the incident, every photographer’s nightmare, but still got enough pictures to shock the world. It will probably win the news category of the World Press Photographic Competition to be judged later this year. Unfortunately Carter will not be there to collect his prize. Late on Wednesday night, he killed himself on the outskirts of Johannesburg. The horrors he had witnessed over the years had finally caught up with him. In his line of work, it was often hard to look, let alone photograph. Carter was only 33, a gaunt, tense, passionate man. Like so many committed photojournalists, for him the picture is the only important thing. He was a second generation Irishman who thrived on the dramatic stories that South Africa, a country of such extremes, has thrown up over the last few decades. After freelancing for most of the international photo agencies, he had finally landed a contract with the   Sygma organisation and was thought to have finally settled and to be getting to grips with his turbulent life. Despite being frequently arrested for infringements of the draconian South African prohibitions on reporting, he was always drawn irresistibly to the heart of the conflict. His tumultuous emotional life brought passion to his work but drove him to extremes of elation and depression.  He often said that if he hadn’t been a photographer he would have liked to have been a racing driver. He liked living close to the edge.  Starting off as a sports photographer in 1983, he had also been a broadcaster and the photo editor of the Daily Mail in Johannesburg during its short life. What has shocked his family and friends is that he has just had such a successful year. He had won a Pulitzer Prize for his famous photograph of a starving baby being stalked by a vulture in the Sudan. He was also awarded the American Magazine Picture of the Year for the same shot, no mean achievement for a ‘foreigner’.  Along with all the good news was some bad. His best friend, Ken Osterbroek, was killed beside him while covering a gun battle in the Thokoza township outside Johannesburg. His   relationship had also broken up. He leaves behind a    daughter.  Jimmy Carter, Kevin’s father, told the South African Press Association on Thursday that his son always carried around the horror of the work he did. In the end it was too much.  • Kevin Carter, born September 13 1960 died July 27 1994 
Fighting death: At 75, nun’s soul still stirs for cause	2014-08-06	2014	8	New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) Sister Helen Prejean blasts the   in her   Toyota Corolla, the back bumper held up with duct tape. It’s clear why friends insist on driving when they are with her. She could rival NASCAR’s Danica Patrick on the gas pedal. Age    she turned 75 this year    hasn’t slowed her down.  She was weaving all over Interstate 10 when police stopped her one time. Turned out she was reading while driving. The officer let her go when he discovered who she was: ”I’ll go straight to hell if I ticket a nun,” he said.  He made her promise she would never do that again.  These days, she depends on iPhone’s Siri for driving directions and making phone calls. She also likes to play ”Plants vs. Zombies” (not while in motion, of course) even though the violent nature of the game goes against her Christian principles.  ”It’s OK,” she says. ”The zombies are already dead.” On this day in late July, Prejean is nearing Louisiana State Penitentiary, otherwise known as Angola, for the post office that serves it. She’s been here so many times the warden no longer subjects her to the protocol for visitors.  She drives down State Highway 66, through the guarded gates, past lush green cypress trees and fields brimming with flowers, okra and collards to Camp F, where the prison constructed a $9 million brick building to lock up the condemned. Built on a former slave plantation surrounded on three sides by the Mississippi River, Angola is the nation’s largest   facility. It houses more than 6, 000 inmates and encompasses a chunk of fertile Southern farmland almost the size of Manhattan. Prejean is here to see Manuel Ortiz, convicted in 1992 of the murders of his wife, Tracie Williams, and her friend Cheryl Mallory. He’s been on death row for more than two decades Prejean began visiting him 13 years ago. Ortiz maintains he was framed in a    scheme. Prejean believes his claim of innocence. But that is almost beside the point. Prejean, who gained fame as a death penalty abolitionist after the movie ”Dead Man Walking” hit theaters in 1995, is not always concerned with a convicted murderer’s guilt or innocence. It’s easy to forgive the innocent. It’s the guilty, she says, who test our morality. She ministers to the worst of humanity because she believes in the restoration of life and that every human being deserves to be treated with dignity.  That is what Jesus preached. She likes to say that Christ was more radical than Karl Marx in his embrace of the lowest rungs of society. Three decades ago, Prejean embarked on a mission to end the death penalty based on her Catholic faith and belief in human rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, she says, forbids torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment. Ministering to death row inmates and learning the intricacies of American criminal justice, Prejean arrived at another steadfast belief: The process is broken.  Outside the entrance to death row, there’s a porch with three dark wooden rocking chairs. The warden, she thinks, could have had a career in decorating the way the place is all fixed up.  A prison staffer leads her into one of the booths reserved for lawyers who come to meet with their clients. She sits on one side of the thick glass with a phone in her hand. Ortiz walks in on the other side with leg irons, handcuffs and a chain around his waist. He always feels cold when he comes out of his   by   cell on death row. It’s not   and has louvered windows. A federal lawsuit filed by three inmates claims the heat index has reached 172 degrees. The first thing Prejean does is order food for Ortiz from prison concessions otherwise he will have to eat the normal slop that is served in the cells and never contains anything fresh.  ”It’s part of the attitude here. You committed a crime so you must always suffer,” Prejean says. She knows Ortiz does not have the money to buy anything. And food is important to her. It is the most basic necessity of life it should be celebrated when shared with family and friends, she says. Ortiz wants a catfish Po’ Boy, a roast beef Po’ Boy, five bags of potato chips, two Cokes and two Sprites. He also orders four strawberry and two cinnamon Danishes for breakfast the next morning and two hamburgers for lunch because Prejean has some money left. She orders a grilled cheese for herself. She and Ortiz pray together.  ”You are a son of God,” she tells death row inmates. ”Christ is with you. What is being done to you is wrong. I will be there for you.” Prejean finds Ortiz in high spirits on this day. With her help, he recently changed lawyers because he felt he wasn’t being heard. He is desperate to prove his innocence and filed for FBI documents pertaining to his case through the Freedom of Information Act. Ortiz dreams about the day he might walk out of Angola. He dreams of taking Prejean to one of the volcanic lakes in his native El Salvador. He wants to teach her to scuba dive. They talk about everything from Marco Polo to J. Robert Oppenheimer’s invention of the atom bomb. The science was so sweet the end result, ghastly. In the last hour of their visit, Ortiz narrates the plot lines to movies he’s seen recently: ”Band of Angels” with Clark Gable and ”The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.”  ”I feel like I’ve seen the movies now,” Prejean says.  It’s as though they were sitting on a couch in someone’s family room, sipping a cocktail    Prejean loves her single malt Scotch    and munching on popcorn.  She lets Ortiz carry on because it gives him dignity. Equal justice under the law, Two troubled and recent executions in Arizona and Oklahoma, Prejean hopes, will trigger more opposition to carrying out the death penalty in the United States, the only country in the Western hemisphere that still puts the convicted to death.  A 2013 Gallup Poll found that 60% of Americans still support capital punishment, though that number is the lowest it has been since 1972, when the Supreme Court constitutionally banned it. Executions are shrouded in secrecy, masked, sanitized, Prejean says. She remains convinced that if people could see the brutality of killing a human being, they might reconsider their support for the death penalty.  Execution is torture, she believes. And so is the time waiting for it. Death row inmates, she says, ”die a thousand times before they physically die.” The July 23 execution by injection of Joseph Wood in Arizona took nearly two hours. Witnesses reported that Wood snorted and gasped for air throughout the process. The April 29 execution of Clayton Lockett in Oklahoma turned into a grisly show as he convulsed and writhed on the gurney and finally died of a heart attack. Both men committed chilling crimes. Wood shot his former partner, Debbie Dietz, and her father, Gene, at their body shop in Tucson. Lockett shot    Stephanie Neiman and then watched accomplices bury her alive. Early Wednesday morning, Missouri became the first state to carry out an execution since the ”botched” lethal injections. The state put to death Michael Worthington for the 1995 rape and murder of college student Melinda Griffin. Death penalty supporters accuse Prejean of having empathy for undeserving, coldblooded killers. The crimes justify the punishment, they say. But even advocates of capital punishment, like R. Albert Mohler Jr. president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, have said it’s one thing to support death as punishment and quite another to explain it, fix it and sustain it with justice. Prejean wants Americans to understand that it’s not just the act of killing that was botched in the cases of Wood and Lockett. She believes the entire death penalty system is botched    from the moment an arrest takes place to the trial, conviction, appeals and execution.  ”It is random, arbitrary and capricious and disproportionately meted out to minorities and poor people,” she says. ”Race plays such a huge role.” If you kill a person of color, Prejean says, you are not likely to be condemned. In 76% of cases in which death is the punishment, the victims were white, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Almost 42% of death row inmates are black even though   make up about 12% of the U. S. population. She directs much of her wrath at the Supreme Court, which, she says, has given absolute power to the states without demanding transparency. Trying out new drug cocktails for lethal injections, she says, amounts to medical experimentation on human beings to see what it takes to kill a person. The court declared the death penalty unconstitutional in 1972 on some of the grounds Prejean talks about. But it was reinstated in 1976 with Gregg v. Georgia. The court held that a punishment of death was not ”cruel and unusual punishment,” violating the Eighth and 14th Amendments, under all circumstances. The ruling found that in the most heinous crimes, the death penalty could be employed it laid out certain procedures to prevent prejudice and arbitrariness in state trials.  But Prejean asks: How can 50 states, bound by the same Constitution and Supreme Court rulings, behave so differently? The high court’s guidelines, she says, are unclear and not workable and so what happens is the culture of each state takes over.  There’s a reason, she says, that a good number of death row inmates are in Southern states that supported slavery. 5 ways to improve the death penalty, Death penalty facts may surprise you, A soul on fire, For a Catholic girl in the 1950s, reaching adulthood meant two things, Prejean jokes. It was either time to get married or enter the sisterhood. She chose the latter and joined the Sisters of St. Joseph of Medaille, now known as the Congregation of St. Joseph. She had been raised in a comfortable household in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, blind to the brutality of Jim Crow laws, oblivious to American poverty. But in the early 1980s, she had an awakening of sorts and decided to dedicate her life to the poor. She went to live at the St. Thomas housing project in New Orleans, a white nun sharing space with very poor black people. That was the start of her real education. It was while living there that she began communicating with Elmo Patrick Sonnier, prisoner number 95821 at Angola. Sonnier and his brother Eddie were convicted in 1978 of abducting a young couple, Loretta Bourque, 18, and David LeBlanc, 16. They raped her and then forced both of them to lie face down on the ground and shot them. Sonnier told Prejean that he was Catholic and asked her to become his spiritual adviser. It was one thing to write letters, she thought. It was another to visit death row.  She was scared to walk into the belly of the beast. She’d never faced a murderer before. The warden asked her what a nun was doing there. She told him she’d come to help Sonnier take responsibility for his terrible deeds. She wondered if he would be a monster.  But everything changed when she saw Sonnier’s face. She knew then that whatever unspeakable act he had committed, his life was worth more than what it was in that criminal moment.  She visited him at Angola until the day he was put to death, April 5, 1984. It was the first time in her life that she had stood up for something. When he was strapped into the oak electric chair, nicknamed Gruesome Gertie, Sonnier looked at Leblanc’s father and asked for forgiveness. And before almost 2, 000 volts charged through his body, he found Prejean’s face on the other side of the glass window.  ”I want the last thing in this world you see to be the face of love,” she’d told him. ”You look at me.” Sonnier’s eyes met Prejean’s. ”I love you,” he told her. She stretched her arm toward him. ”I love you, too.” When it was over, Prejean felt a cold descend on her. On the trip back from Angola, she had to stop the car to get out and vomit. She would never be the same again. The state’s execution of Sonnier set her soul on fire. Death row diary offers glimpse into morbid world, ’Dead Man Walking’ Prejean has witnessed five other executions since that day. She’s written two books: ”Dead Man Walking” was turned into a movie starring Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn ”The Death of Innocents” focuses on two men she believes were wrongly executed. She is working on a third book now, a spiritual memoir called ”River of Fire.” ”Dead Man Walking” sparked a national debate on the death penalty at a time when executions were more common than they are now. Since 1976, America has put to death 1, 385 people. She travels around the world, lecturing on capital punishment    she savors airplanes as her cloister, where no one can get to her. She often attends performances of the play ”Dead Man Walking,” written by Tim Robbins for student actors and audiences. It is intended to make a new generation of Americans ponder the death penalty.  All of it has contributed to making Prejean one of America’s     penalty activists. She has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize three times. In her hectic life, she still finds time to meditate every day and attend weekly Mass at St. Gabriel the Archangel, a predominantly   Catholic Church in New Orleans.  After all these years, her body tires more quickly but the fire inside still burns.  I’d read Prejean’s books, seen ”Dead Man Walking” several times. I had an image in my mind based on Sarandon’s portrayal of her. Compassionate, committed, dedicated, serious about her work. I wondered if I would find a woman who had grown weary from 30 years of death. I discover otherwise. She repeats a joke she told recently at a California forum celebrating the life of Catholic priest and Earth scholar Thomas Berry. ”There’s an old guy sitting on a bench with a young guy with a Mohawk hairdo and covered with tattoos and piercings,” she begins in her deep Cajun voice. ”Whassa matter, pops? Didn’t you ever do something wild in your life?” asks the young guy.  ”Yeah. One time, I had sex with a parrot. I was checking you out and thought you might be my son.” Prejean looks at me with a mischievous smile, taking in my shock at a nun    a death penalty nun    making a rather juvenile joke. But without humor, without relaxation and good friends, her work would be overwhelming. She dispels every cliché about Catholic nuns. She’s wearing a blue printed blouse, cotton pants and tan leather mules. She doesn’t even have a cross around her neck. I ask about her lack of gray hair, despite the stress in her life.  ”I don’t know how that happened. It’s like the immaculate conception.” Then she admits she likes to keep it that way so it matches her spirit. Sarandon was equally surprised by Prejean’s demeanor when she first met her. ”Dead Man Walking” had just been published. The Hollywood star was in New Orleans filming ”The Client” and called up Prejean. They met for a crawfish dinner at The Bon Ton Café on Magazine Street. ”I have to say I was predisposed against religion,” Sarandon says of her Catholic school experiences. ”I brought all that baggage to dinner. But she was very accessible. She has a bit of wonder.” Sarandon was taken with Prejean’s personal involvement with death row inmates that she never asked about their guilt. She had the unconditional love of a mother for her child. ”I became completely mesmerized,” Sarandon says. ”She was a big laugher, eater, drinker. We ate tons of crawfish that night. ”People have such a wrong idea of activists. They think of these people as scolding,   personalities when it has been my experience that they are the most celebratory    dancing, singing, partaking of food and wine in the biggest way possible. Craving for social justice is another craving they have and that doesn’t mean they are closed off to other avenues.” Sarandon made no promises to Prejean that night but told her she was interested in making a movie. It took nine months before she could convince her     Robbins, to read it and take on the project. In 1995, the movie,   and directed by Robbins, screened in American theaters. Sarandon won an Oscar for her portrayal of Prejean. Sean Penn’s character, Matthew Poncelet, was a composite of Patrick Sonnier and Robert Lee Willie, whose crime sounded like it was straight out of Truman Capote’s ”In Cold Blood.” A grave mistake, When a death penalty lawyer contacted Prejean and filled her in on Willie’s crime, the first people she thought about were the victim’s family.  Faith Hathaway’s stepfather and mother, Vernon and Elizabeth Harvey, had both been very public with their support for the death penalty. They said they couldn’t wait to see Willie fry. Prejean had never visited the families of Sonnier’s victims. The first time she saw them was at a clemency board hearing where she asked the state to spare the life of the man who killed their loved ones.  The family of Loretta Bourque, one of Sonnier’s victims, later told reporters that they were deeply hurt that Loretta’s death was used to sell an   penalty book and movie without anyone ever speaking to them. Prejean recognized she’d made a grave mistake    one she was determined not to repeat    even if the families rejected her. The church, she says, has to be on both sides. DePaul University’s special collection on Helen Prejean’s ministry, She knew many victims’ families despised her, as did advocates of the death penalty. They saw her as someone who showed sympathy for vile human beings who deserved to die for their sins. They blamed her for not siding with innocent victims. There were some crimes, they argued, that just could not be forgiven. Willie’s was one of them. He and his accomplice, Joseph Vaccaro, blindfolded and raped    Hathaway, then stabbed her in the neck and upper chest 17 times. They left her to die in the woods. Some fingers of her right hand were missing she’d tried to shield herself from her attackers.  Four years after the murder, when Willie’s execution seemed imminent, Prejean went to visit the Harveys at their home in Covington, a small town on the north side of Lake Pontchartrain. She thought of a prayer to Mary, who watched her son dying on a cross. ”Great as the sea is thy sorrow.” The Harveys talked about their daughter and the events of May 28, 1980, the day tragedy struck their family. They talked about what Willie and Vaccaro had done to their daughter in graphic detail. They told Prejean that the only way to be certain an unrepentant madman like Willie would never kill again was to kill him. Prejean recounted her conversation with the Harveys in her book. ”The SOB, Vaccaro, got a life sentence,” Vernon Harvey told Prejean. ”And it’s been four years and they haven’t fried Willie’s ass yet. We’ve been waiting and waiting for justice to be done. All you hear about these days is the rights of the criminal. What about our rights? Don’t we have a right to see this chapter closed?” The intensity of the Harveys’ sorrow silenced Prejean in that moment.  But now, 30 years later in her modest New Orleans   apartment, she explains why she believes the death penalty   people. If a killer is sentenced to life in prison, he or she is locked up and never heard from again. But a condemned man?  That killer makes news every time there is movement in the case: a hearing, an appeal, a court ruling. Death row inmates typically spend over a decade awaiting execution, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Sometimes, it can last over two decades, as was the case with Troy Davis, put to death in Georgia in September 2011 for the killing of a police officer in 1989. Prejean says she has seen victims’ families follow cases through the courts for years. They wait and wait, reliving the crime over and over again with the hope that they will find ”closure” when the killer dies. The Harveys, Prejean says, could have watched Willie get electrocuted a thousand times and still it would never fill the void in their lives. Vernon Harvey, she says, was a thirsty man drinking a tall glass of salty water. ”He went home after they killed Willie but (his daughter) Faith is never going to sit in her chair again,” she says. ”Victims’ families buy into the notion that the death penalty is a way of honoring their loved ones.” A growing number of victims’ families are speaking out against capital punishment, she says. In 2007, 62 families sent letters to New Jersey legislators urging passage of an abolition bill. They emphasized the painful toll the process had taken on them. Prejean has a framed photo of a brightly lit Colosseum, home to gladiators and executions during the Roman Empire. But in the 1990s, Rome began lighting up the ancient arena every time the death penalty was abolished somewhere in the world. It did just that the day New Jersey’s bill became law. ’Nunzilla,’ and ardent foes, Prejean’s apartment is filled with art, books and photographs. There’s a depiction of Christ done in batik, which she acquired in Jaipur, India. She calls it her ”yogi Jesus.” And a Bible verse, John 10:10, written in Korean calligraphy. I ask her what it says. ”I ain’t a Baptist so I don’t know Bible quoting like a Baptist,” she says, picking up her holy book to look up the verse. ” ’I have come that they may have life to the full.’ ” On her coffee table is a magazine with Sarandon on the cover. And a copy of J. D. Salinger’s ”Franny and Zooey.” She likes the image of the Fat Lady in that book. Jesus, she says, was the Fat Lady, representing people with faults whom no one loves.  Next to the table, on a buffet, is a photo of Prejean’s mother, from whom she says she gets her spunk, and a toy that Sean Penn sent to her. It’s a windup plastic nun that sparks fire from her mouth. ”I told him: ’Sean, Nunzilla’s gonna get you. ’” Next door is the office for Prejean’s Ministry Against the Death Penalty. Her longtime friend Sister Margaret Maggio runs the place and makes sure Prejean is on track with her hectic schedule.  ”Helen thinks big. She has big dreams, big hopes,” Maggio says. ”I’m  . I’m the backbone.” Maggio keeps track of all the letters and   Prejean receives. They are kept neatly in folders. One, colored purple, is called ”Ardent Foes.” In it are printed copies of   lashing Prejean. One man wrote: ”There has not been one instance on the planet where an executed convict ever committed another homicide. The U. S. justice system is the fairest in the world. If you are judged guilty by a jury of your peers based on the evidence presented that is the way it works. If you do not like it then get out of the country.” Prejean marked it a ”classic” and asked her staff to post it on her Web page. In the days ahead, she will travel to a monastery in Wyoming to complete her memoir. Then she will return home to Louisiana to visit Manuel Ortiz on death row again. She holds on to an idea that was cemented the moment she threw up after Patrick Sonnier’s execution: that Americans are far removed from   death but when they get close to it, they will reject it.  ”And I see that happening,” she says, the smile wiped off her face. Her wish is to see the death penalty abolished in her lifetime.  For a second, I think Prejean will break the seriousness of the moment with another one of her ”bad Cajun jokes,” as she calls them. Instead, she asks: ”You hungry?” It’s time to go grab a Louisiana Po’ Boy.  Follow CNN’s Moni Basu on Twitter

For A More Ordered Life, Organize Like A Chef	2014-08-11	2014	8	Americans are obsessed with celebrity chefs. We talk about them, tweet about them and try to eat like them. But could we learn something more from them than recipes and technique? According to Marketdata Enterprises, Americans spend nearly $10 billion a year on   and personal organization products. The market is huge, partly because most colleges and grad schools don’t teach basic organization. But culinary schools and professional kitchens do. Perhaps the principles of culinary organization can be extended to help even those of us who aren’t top chefs. The system that makes kitchens go is called    or, literally, ”put in place.” It’s a French phrase that means to gather and arrange the ingredients and tools needed for cooking. But for many culinary professionals, the phrase connotes something deeper. Some cooks call it their religion. It helps them coordinate vast amounts of labor and material, and transforms the lives of its practitioners through focus and  . ”I know people that have it tattooed on them,” says Melissa Gray, a senior at the Culinary Institute of America. ”It really is a way of life . .. it’s a way of concentrating your mind to only focus on the aspects that you need to be working on at that moment, to kind of rid yourself of distractions.” And it’s a habit that some culinary students carry with them even when they’re not in the kitchen. ”You    your life. You set up your books for class, you set up your chef whites, your shoes are shined, you know everything that you need every step of the day,” says Alexandra Tibbats, another student at the CIA. Gray says that she now arranges her home office as she would her   . ”My desk is specifically organized based off of where I reach for things the most. [It’s] being so methodical to the point that you continually put your pen back in one specific place.” Ok, so how does one attain this level of organization? ”It starts with your list,” says Wylie Dufresne, the James Beard   chef and owner of New York restaurants wd~50 and Alder. ”What I used to do is, let’s say I had 23 items of    I had to do every day. So I’d take a pad and I’d write them all down on the way home. And then I would crumple the list up and throw it out,” he says. ”On my way to work I’d write the list again. And you become one with your list. You and the list are the same, because the list is scorched into your head.” But the key to    is not so much the list, but the mindset. Cooks can easily do six hours of prep for a   dinner shift.    forces cooks to account for every minute of their time and, says chef Dwayne Lipuma, every movement. ”Every component of one single dish is in one single corner so their hand literally moves inches,” explains Lipuma, an instructor at the CIA. ”Once [students] set up their station I should be able to blindfold them and tell them . .. and they should know that their tongs are always here, their oil is always right here, their salt and pepper is always right here. ” That way, chefs are always ready to go, Lipuma says. ”They always have one foot pivoted just like a basketball player.” At Esca, an Italian restaurant in Manhattan’s theater district,   Greg Barr describes what is perhaps the central tenet of   : working clean. ”It’s like a very . ..   thing,” he says. ”All my knives are clean. Clean cutting board. Clear space to work. Clear mind.” Working clean in the kitchen is paramount because unclean food is dangerous. If chefs don’t work clean, people can get sick. And it’s also important to clean as you go, says Dufresne. ”Oh my God! If you don’t clean as you go it is a mess!” he says. ”And that’s another thing you people at home could do: Because isn’t the worst thing at the end of a successful dinner party doing a whole bunch of dishes? Wouldn’t you rather break them all and buy new ones? It actually saves time if you clean as you go. It makes life so much easier.” Across town at Telepan, chef and owner Bill Telepan explains another principle of   : slow down to speed up. ”I always say, ’Look, I’d rather you take an extra minute or two and slow up service to get it right.’ Because the one minute behind you are now is going to become six minutes behind because we’re going to have to redo the plate.” Upstairs in the kitchen, this issue plays out as Telepan coaches a new chef on how to make, of all things, a grilled cheese sandwich: ”That’s not done fire another one,” he says. ”Be patient. I know it’s a grilled cheese sandwich but it’s gotta be a [expletive] great grilled cheese sandwich, you know what I mean?” Some chefs say that    is nothing more than a kitchen version of good   military discipline. After all, the rigid culinary hierarchy codified in the 19th century by   Escoffier is called the ”brigade system.” ”A chef, because of    he’s always on time,” says Andre Soltner, dean of the International Culinary Center in New York City. He demands the same kind of efficiency outside his kitchen. ”If I go to the doctor, and if he’s not ready, I leave. And that’s because of   .” Other chefs  —   like Ari Bokovza of New York’s The Harrison  —   admit that this can make domestic life a little intense: ”The way we are at work starts to translate into the way we are at home. You wish that you could switch it off. If you asked my girl, you know, ’How is Ari at home?’ She’ll tell you, ’He’s a [expletive] nut job! He can’t sit still!’ ” But practiced at its highest level,    says that time is precious. Resources are precious. Space is precious. Your   and the respect of others are precious. Use them wisely. Isn’t that a philosophy for our time? ”The world is a giant gerbil wheel right now,” Lipuma at the CIA says. ”I think if we just became a little bit more organized, a little bit more    [understand] what we really need and only do what we really need, I think we’ll have more time”  —   time for what’s important, he says. ”You’ll be able to sit down at the table with your kids and actually cook a meal. Get up a little bit earlier so you could breathe. You want to greet the day.”
College Football Playoff Fast Facts	2014-08-14	2014	8	 (CNN) Here’s a look at the College Football Playoff, a   seeded postseason format which began for the 2014 season and replaced the Bowl Championship Series (BCS).  January 9, 2017   The Clemson Tigers defeat the Alabama Crimson Tide   to win the 2017 College Football Playoff National Championship.   Other Facts:The   selection committee selects and seeds the four playoff teams. (Number 1 will play Number 4 Number 2 will play Number 3). The original number of committee members was 13. The two winning teams of the semifinal games advance to the title game, which determines the Division I FBS college football national champion. This replaces the heavily criticized BCS postseason system, which ran from the   seasons and was often accused of unfairness relating to team selections. The College Football Playoff generates higher revenue than the BCS, resulting in ”at least double the annual revenue” for each of the 10 Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) Conferences. The College Football Playoff trophy, presented to the championship team, is handmade, stands 26. 5 inches tall and is constructed from   gold, bronze and stainless steel. The playoff is contracted from the   season through at least the   season.  Selection Committee:The committee members, which include athletic directors, conference commissioners, former coaches and players, and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, serve on staggered   terms. The 12 Selection Committee Members, After the ninth week of regular season play, the   selection committee begins ranking the top 25 teams on a weekly basis. The committee identifies and compares the top teams, then votes them into the rankings. Towards the end of the regular season, selection weekend takes place, where the committee determines the playoff matchups. The committee selects teams based on conference championship wins, overall   records, strength of schedule,    matchups and other criteria. The selection committee is also responsible for choosing the teams which play in the Cotton, Fiesta and Peach Bowls in years those bowls are not hosting the semifinal games. (The Rose, Sugar and Orange Bowls have previous existing contracts with conferences). Members are recused from voting when ”they or an immediate family member receives compensation from the school or has a professional relationship with that school.”  Bowl Game Locations:Semifinal playoff games rotate between the Sugar Bowl, Rose Bowl, Orange Bowl, Cotton Bowl, Chick   Peach Bowl and Fiesta Bowl. Cities interested in hosting the national championship game must submit a bid, in a process similar to bidding for a Super Bowl site. Timeline:June 26, 2012   A BCS oversight committee of university presidents approves the   seeded postseason format presented by the BCS commissioners, to begin in the 2014 season and continue through the 2025 regular season (2026 bowl games). November 21, 2012   ESPN announces it has obtained the rights for the new college football playoffs from 2014 through the 2025 season. April 23, 2013   The College Football Playoff is announced as the name of the new system to replace the BCS. October 16, 2013   The names of the 13 members of the selection committee are announced. January 6, 2014   The final BCS National Championship game is played in Pasadena, California. The Florida State Seminoles beat the Auburn Tigers  . July 14, 2014   The CFP National Championship trophy is unveiled. October 28, 2014   The selection committee begins issuing weekly rankings for the top 25 teams.  December   2014   Selection weekend takes place. The committee releases the matchups for the inaugural playoffs and for the other bowl games.

Reuniting soldiers with dogs they left behind	2014-08-14	2014	8	 (CNN) Staff Sgt. Edwin Caba served in Afghanistan for nearly three years. Like his fellow soldiers, he longed for a sense of normalcy during his tours. ”We’d spend hours not sleeping, and rushing to eat meals, and staying on guard,” said Caba, 26. When a litter of puppies was born on the base where Caba served, the animals provided just the relief he needed.  ”You walk in, and the dogs are wagging their tails, jumping on your legs and so excited to see you,” Caba said. ”You forget that you’re halfway across the world, in a desert, with hostile things going on.” The soldiers began feeding, bathing and caring for the puppies, and Caba bonded with one in particular.  ”She was sleeping on her back, with her mouth wide open, her tongue out a little bit and it was such a dopey thing to do    and it’s just like me,” said Caba, who named the dog Cadence. ”So I kind of knew that was it for me.” But a few months later, the soldiers’ tour was coming to an end. Determined not to leave the dogs behind, they searched for a way to get them to America.  That’s when Caba was connected with Nowzad Dogs. Since 2007, the organization has reunited hundreds of soldiers with the stray dogs and cats they rescued while serving on the front lines. ”On every single street corner in Kabul you will find stray dogs,” said Pen Farthing, a former Royal Marine sergeant who founded the nonprofit. ”To be able to get that animal home to them, it closes the loop. . .. They don’t want to just abandon that animal.” Soldier’s best friend, Farthing knows firsthand the bond that can form between a soldier and a dog. In 2006, while on patrol in Afghanistan, he and his troops encountered a dog fight. ”We broke up that dog fight not realizing that one of those dogs was actually going to adopt me,” said Farthing, 45.   The dog followed Farthing back to base. They became friends, and Farthing named him Nowzad, after the town where he saved him. ”He was just   and battered, just like the town we were actually fighting over,” he said. For several months, Farthing and Nowzad filled an important void in each other’s lives.  ”As the troop sergeant, I was there to motivate the guys and get them fired up again to go out and do the job. . .. But no one was doing that for me,” Farthing said. ”My time with this dog was a way of   collecting my thoughts and popping my head back in the game.”  After his tour ended, Farthing went through a difficult process to get Nowzad home to Britain. He realized he not only wanted to help other soldiers do the same, he wanted to do more to help Afghanistan. ”One day you are fighting the Taliban, and the next day you are home and grocery shopping,” Farthing said. ”When I got home, I thought, ’What am I doing here?’ I didn’t want to leave Afghanistan forever.” Today, Nowzad Dogs also works to promote animal welfare in the country.  The group’s shelter and clinic in Kabul are staffed by 14 Afghan nationals, four of whom are trained veterinarians. The group   street dogs and cats and vaccinates them against rabies to reduce the stray animal population. In turn, those efforts help protect residents by having fewer rabid animals roaming the streets. Farthing said his organization has the only official animal shelter in Afghanistan. The group also places rescued animals in caring homes there. Journey to a new home  Farthing’s group has reunited animals with nearly 700 service members from eight countries. Soldiers’ dogs and cats are first brought to the shelter in Kabul, where kennel manager and former British soldier Louise Hastie begins the quarantine process. All animals are   vaccinated and  . They spend two to three months at the shelter before being transported to the soldier’s home country. Last year, Caba and fellow soldiers were reunited in New York with the puppies for which they had cared.  ”When I pulled Cadence out of the crate at (the airport) I was just so excited. I was even more excited that she remembered me,” Caba said. ”It kind of brought me back to coming back after a mission and having her there. It brought me right back to that feeling.” Nowzad lived with Farthing in Britain for the last six years until the dog’s recent death. For Farthing, he was a constant reminder of their journey. ”My connection with Afghanistan stayed alive because of Nowzad,” Farthing said. ”So for me, every time I look at him, it just makes me smile. I could never have dreamed that we’d be doing something like this in Afghanistan.” Want to get involved? Check out the Nowzad Dogs’ website at www. nowzad. org and see how to help.
Mentally ill: How do you know they won’t kill again?	2014-08-15	2014	8	Augusta, Maine (CNN) When Bill Stokes visits a cafe near the state Capitol, he admires one man behind the counter. To him, Chuck Petrucelly represents a life saved. Editor’s note: ”If only they had treated him before” follows one family’s journey through the aftermath of a killing. Stokes headed the Maine attorney general’s criminal division when his office accepted Petrucelly’s insanity plea in the 2008 killing of his brother.  ”I take some measure of satisfaction from the fact he’s a young man who has a future,” Stokes says. ”We had an opportunity to save him. Unfortunately, the wheels of justice kicked in after a horrific tragedy. ”There’s no punishment I can give Chuck that’s worse than the punishment he gives himself whenever he thinks about his brother.”  The former prosecutor and   Augusta mayor was recently appointed a Superior Court judge. He sees Petrucelly’s recovery from multiple viewpoints. As a citizen, civic leader, head prosecutor and judge. Petrucelly is one of 90 mentally ill people in Maine designated as not criminally responsible    known as NCR patients    because they were determined to be insane at the time of the crimes. Nineteen had faced murder charges. The rest were charged with an array of offenses, including aggravated assault, arson, stalking and sexual misconduct. ”As a prosecutor, you can’t be so rigid you reject the idea that there really are people who are truly insane,” Stokes says. ”The people I’m worried about are not the forensics patients, because they’re getting the best treatment you can imagine. The people I’m worried about are the people who are severely mentally ill not getting treatment. They’re the next case that I don’t want to see.” Petrucelly was sent to the state psychiatric hospital with the goal of rehabilitation. He remained there for 4½ years and moved out of the hospital more than a year ago. Now 29, he lives alone in a supervised apartment in downtown Augusta. He tries not to dwell on the past. His brother was a year older the two had been inseparable growing up. They played Nintendo, lifted weights and shared that indescribable bond of brotherhood.  ”There’s just a connection I had with him that I just don’t have with anybody else, and nothing can replace it,” Petrucelly says. ”Mike really was my best friend. That might be hard to believe with what happened. ”The past is very hard to work through.” The biggest aid in his recovery, he says, was the forgiveness of his six other siblings and his mother, who remains his greatest advocate. ”You don’t give up on one of your sons,” says Rosanne Towle, his mother. ”Losing Mike was devastating and still is. Part of me is broken. But Chuck is here and he still needs us. So our focus is on him.” Focus on rehabilitation, Maine’s NCR statute says that a defendant is not criminally responsible by reason of insanity ”if, at the time of the criminal conduct, as a result of mental disease or defect, the defendant lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of the criminal conduct.” Each defendant undergoes rigorous psychiatric assessment. About 5% of the state’s cases result in a person being found not criminally responsible. ”Once that decision is made, the focus shifts from punishment to rehabilitation, treatment and public safety,” Stokes says. The length of a stay depends on how a patient responds to treatment. That can range from a couple of years to decades. Typically, the younger the patient is on arrival, officials say, the better likelihood of a quicker recovery.  The program has been in place for more than 50 years, but was revamped after an NCR patient on a   leave in 1985 killed a teenage girl. Stricter laws govern today’s treatment program. That case also led to creation of the State Forensic Service, which conducts psychiatric and psychological evaluations for the court system.  In the three decades since, state officials say, no NCR patient has committed a violent felony upon return to the community. ”The history of the experience speaks volumes,” says Mary Mayhew, commissioner of Maine’s Department of Health and Human Services. ”We don’t have an experience of recidivism. . .. We’re focused on recovery and the   standards of care. It’s slow. It’s thorough. The assessments and progress are comprehensive and are consistently being evaluated.” Patients who once refused treatment, who could hardly utter a coherent sentence, begin to surrender to therapy, start taking medication and over time become functional. The treatment plan is based on incremental freedoms and stringent rules.  As they progress, they can petition the court to move into a group home after years of therapy, then to a supervised apartment. Eventually, they can seek full release, as happened recently with a mother who starved her    daughter to death in 1993. Other states have similar programs, but the approach and aggressiveness of the releases vary. While Maine has shown success in rehabilitating its patients, other states haven’t fared so well.  Dr. Fuller Torrey, a research psychiatrist,   author and founder of the Treatment Advocacy Center, has been tracking patients who killed again upon their release into the community. ”There is no shortage of them,” he says. Once patients have undergone treatment, Torrey says, ”it is imperative to then guarantee to the community, as well as to the person, that this individual will remain on medication indefinitely. And that’s the issue.” States have an incentive to move patients into the community and out of the hospital quickly, Torrey says, because the federal government picks up the cost when patients live in the community. And that, Torrey says, has resulted with patients being let go too soon and with drastic consequences. Ann LeBlanc, director of Maine’s State Forensic Service, says authorities work extremely hard to make sure that doesn’t happen. ”What we know from years of research,” she says, ”if people make that transition too soon, they tend to have multiple offenses, dangerous behavior. So we go very slowly through that process.” She often faces heated questions, even among friends and family, about why the state allows mentally ill patients, especially those who have killed, back into the community. She tells them: ”That mental illness is treated and stable, and that they’ve had years to work hard and demonstrate that stability.” ”It’s a slow, stepwise process,” LeBlanc says. ”We keep an eye out for the safety of the community, and the hospital makes proposals based on what the patient wants or needs. The judge decides.” Since 2001, when Stokes took over the Maine attorney general’s criminal division, 12 people have been deemed not criminally responsible in murder cases. Most killed a family member or somebody close to them. Five others who sought NCR status were rejected at trial and sentenced to prison.  ”There’s always that concern that someone is gaming the system    that someone is pretending to be insane when they’re not in order to avoid criminal responsibility,” Stokes says. ”We’re very conscious of that.” Yet officials acknowledge there is no crystal ball, no way to predict how a patient will react upon release. The question they face most from an astonished public is: How do you know they won’t kill again?  ”There are no guarantees,” says LeBlanc, ”and oftentimes I think the community is looking for a guarantee when we can’t provide that about anybody. ”What we can say is these people that are under the commissioner’s custody get the best care they get the care that they need they get the supervision they need so they can have a life.” Petrucelly has begun his new life, but there are hitches. Every time he seeks more freedom, he must appear before court. That results in a local headline like: ”Central Maine man who fatally stabbed brother can move to apartment, judge says.” He says local reporters never ask to speak with him, never seek his side of the story. His mom wishes they’d stop running his arraignment photograph in which he was 150 pounds, in psychosis and looks totally out of it. If they’d just ask to take a new photo, his mother would be happy.  ”It sets up people to be afraid of me,” Petrucelly says. The cafe where he works has accepted him and remains supportive. Making Reuben sandwiches isn’t his ultimate goal. With a hulking   frame, Petrucelly hopes to become a fitness instructor one day. He can   425 pounds. Residents have no reason to fear him, he says.  ”The people who have had treatment, like myself, are not the ones that they need to worry about. Myself specifically, I’m aware of my illness,” he says. ”I’m aware of the fact that I need to take meds to remain stable or I need to watch how I’m thinking and manage my thoughts.” He’s determined to make his late brother proud of his recovery. ”Part of the reason I don’t give up on myself,” he says, ”is I know that my brother wouldn’t want that. I know he’d want me to honor his memory in whatever way I can. Every day that I live and get up, I don’t take it for granted because I know he doesn’t have that now.”

5 questions for my son’s abductor	2014-08-28	2014	8	 (CNN) October 22 will mark 25 years since my son Jacob was taken from his family as he rode his bike home with his brother and a friend on a rural Minnesota road.   Jacob was a fun, active, athletic, kind,    boy who loved peanut butter and football.  He was most known for his sense of fairness. Not knowing what happened or who abducted Jacob has left so many unanswered questions for Jacob’s father, sisters, brother and me.   If I had the chance to talk face to face with the man who took my son away, here’s what I’d want to know: Who are you?   I believe that somebody knows. It’s time to quit protecting the bad guy, even if it is a family member. It’s time to speak up for Jacob. Please tell me who took our son. If YOU are the abductor, it’s time to tell.  You can’t feel good about this. Find some peace. Please write back. The unwavering search for our missing kids, Is Jacob still alive?  Sometimes the phone rings and there is no one there. It’s probably a telemarketer or a wrong number, but my heart cries out, ”Jacob, are you there?” I save articles of ”kids” who came home after long periods of time: three months, nine months, four years, 7½ years, 10 years, 18½ years.  It CAN happen. I don’t know, so I hope and pray that you got away, Jacob. We need you back. We love you more than the flowers love the sun and the rain. My heart wants to believe you’re OK.  Please give us some answers. What made you think you could steal a child?   Jacob is so deeply loved and missed by his mom and dad, brother, sisters, cousins, neighbors and friends. I have read a lot about kidnappers and child molesters and I know that you are all people, human beings that need help.  Maybe you feel bad. Maybe you told someone, but I still live with so many questions    like, how could you? And how could anyone still keep the secret? You can free yourself of carrying this. Please explain this to me.  2009: Jaycee Dugard’s story gives hope, Why didn’t you let him go?   What happened? You probably had other boys that you victimized and released. I think you meant to let him go and something went terribly wrong. I need to know what happened. Please talk to me. What was the last thing that Jacob said to you?  Jacob had a keen sense of fairness and always stood up for people who he thought needed an ally, a friend. He probably would have befriended you too. I need to hear his voice again or to hear the last words he said if he can’t speak to me himself. Please tell me. More on Jacob’s story

Watch how Louisiana’s coastline has vanished over the last 80 years	2014-08-30	2014	8	  Over the last 80 years, Louisiana has lost nearly 2, 000 square miles of coastland  —   land that has simply vanished into the Gulf of Mexico. And much, much more land is likely to disappear in the years ahead unless major changes are made.    That’s the subject of a terrific 2014 investigation from Bob Marshall of The Lens and Brian Jacobs and Al Shaw of ProPublica. You should absolutely go read their entire piece (and check out all of their excellent visuals) but I’ve made a slider image out of two key maps to highlight the very basic change at play here:           Slide your cursor over the map to see the change (  Lens) It’s worth noting that this mostly isn’t a story about global warming and   rise  —   at least not yet. The land in southeast Louisiana was built up over thousands of years from sediment washed down by the Mississippi River and anchored by plant life in the marshes and wetlands. Without this replenishing, the soil would simply sink into the Gulf of Mexico.    Levees and the oil industry have caused the land to sink into the Gulf of Mexico    And over the past century, various human activities have disrupted this ecosystem. After the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, the US Army Corps of Engineers built up a series of levees along the Mississippi that controlled springtime flooding but also blocked sediment from washing down the river and replenishing the delta. At the same time, the Louisiana coast became a major source of oil and gas during the 20th century. That meant two things. Energy companies dredged thousands of miles of canals through the wetlands to transport equipment through  —   and those canals allowed shoreline to crumble and saltwater to seep in, killing off plants. Meanwhile, some scientists argue that the land itself has sunk after companies extracted oil and gas from underground wells.    The   piece is a vivid and detailed exploration of these dynamics (though I’d add one more factor  —   the nutria, an invasive rodent species, is also helping destroy the wetlands). Add it up, and the state now loses some 16 square miles of land each year. That can have all sorts of economic impacts  —   Louisiana’s   shrimp and crab fisheries depend on wetlands as nursery areas, for one. And the loss of land leaves New Orleans and other cities even more exposed to flooding during severe storms. So what might Louisiana’s coast look like in the future? This is where global warming enters the picture. As the world heats up and the ice caps melt, sea levels are slowly rising. So far, this has been a minor contributor to Louisiana’s vanishing coastline. But it’s expected to become a much bigger factor in the future. Global sea levels are currently rising 3. 2 millimeters per year, on average. But the pace has been much faster in parts of Louisiana, because the activities mentioned above that are causing to land to sink  —   sea levels are rising 9. 2 millimeters per year near Grand Isle, La.    And if sea level rise accelerates in the decades ahead, as many scientists expect it will, then southeast Louisiana could end up one of the   areas. Below is a map by Louisiana State University’s Mike Blum showing what the state’s coastline could look like in 2100 in the   scenarios:           (Mike Blum, original image from NASA’s GeoCover Data) Now, the scenario in this map isn’t inevitable. There’s still a range of projections for future   rise  —   this is just one of them, albeit one that dramatically underscores how vulnerable the region is. So is there anything the state can do? Back in 2012, Louisiana policymakers unveiled a master plan for storm protection and coastal restoration that would, among other things, revamp the system of levees and allow controlled flooding to replenish the delta. That could at least help slow the sinking. The hitch: this plan is estimated to cost more than $90 billion in all and is still far from fully funded  —   a study last November by Tulane Law School’s Mark Davis estimated that the state was still $71 billion short. Further reading    You should definitely read the full   piece for the full story on Louisiana’s land loss. And here’s a great Q&A with the authors.    In Hakai magazine, Julia Rosen recently wrote a great piece about the (controversial) proposal to use controlled flooding to replenish the Mississippi River Delta. That’s very much worth reading.

In America, Labor Day is a lie	2014-09-01	2014	9	 Labor Day is a day of rest that commemorates years of war. Congress inaugurated the holiday just days after President Grover Cleveland sent 12, 000 federal troops to break the Pullman strike. The tactics were bloody; US deputy marshals killed two men and wounded many more.    That was 1894, an election year. Cleveland needed a way to win workers back to his side. He saw an opportunity in a federal holiday honoring workers  —   as well as organized labor. ”The movement for a national Labor Day had been growing for some time,” writes PBS NewsHour. ”In September 1892, union workers in New York City took an unpaid day off and marched around Union Square in support of the holiday. But now, protests against President Cleveland’s harsh methods made the appeasement of the nation’s workers a top political priority. In the immediate wake of the strike, legislation was rushed unanimously through both houses of Congress, and the bill arrived on President Cleveland’s desk just six days after his troops had broken the Pullman strike.” A simple place to start the discussion of rights and wrongs is with Labor Day itself    Samuel Gompers, head of the American Federation of Labor, said Labor Day would be ”the day for which the toilers in past centuries looked forward, when their rights and their wrongs would be discussed.”    He did not say it would be a good day for barbecues. A simple place to start the discussion of rights and wrongs is with Labor Day itself. Labor Day is a federal holiday, which means that federal employees get the day off, and some federally chartered businesses have to give their employees the day off. But there’s no guarantee that workers in private businesses will get the day off with pay  —   Time reports that data collected by Bloomberg BNA shows roughly 40 percent of employers require some employees to come into work on Labor Day.    It’s not just Labor Day. The United States is the only developed country in the world that doesn’t guarantee workers in private businesses any paid days off at all, as this chart from the Center for Economic and Policy Research shows:           (CEPR) This isn’t to say that paid vacation days are unknown to American workers. Many, even most, workers get a few each year. Workers with   skills won’t accept a job where they can’t take a day off now and again. But workers with less bargaining power often have to accept jobs where they don’t get paid days off. The result is that the people with the worst jobs are least able to take the occasional vacation. America is the richest country the world has ever known. We can afford to guarantee workers a few days of paid rest a year.

20 Years Later, Parts Of Major Crime Bill Viewed As Terrible Mistake	2014-09-12	2014	9	Twenty years ago this week, in 1994,   Bill Clinton signed a crime bill. It was, in effect, a   experiment in various ways to fight crime. The measure paid to put more cops on the beat, trained police and lawyers to investigate domestic violence, imposed tougher prison sentences and provided money for extra prisons. Clinton described his motivation to pass the 1994 Violent Crime Control Act in stark terms. ”Gangs and drugs have taken over our streets and undermined our schools,” he said. ”Every day, we read about somebody else who has literally gotten away with murder.” And if Clinton and Congress reflected the punitive mindset of the American people, what they didn’t know was that soaring murder rates and violent crime had already begun what would become a long downward turn, according to criminologists and policymakers. Nicholas Turner is president of the Vera Institute, a nonprofit that researches crime policy. Turner took a minute this week to consider the    rhetoric of the 1990s. ”Criminal justice policy was very much driven by public sentiment and a political instinct to appeal to the more negative punitive elements of public sentiment rather than to be driven by the facts,” he said. And that public sentiment called for filling up the nation’s prisons, a key part of the 1994 crime bill. These days, Jeremy Travis is president of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. But 20 years ago, he attended the signing ceremony for the crime bill  —   and joined the Clinton Justice Department. ”Here’s the federal government coming in and saying we’ll give you money if you punish people more severely, and 28 states and the District of Columbia followed the money and enacted stricter sentencing laws for violent offenses,” Travis says. But as Travis now knows all too well, there’s a problem with that idea. Researchers including a National Academy of Sciences panel he led have since found only a modest relationship between incarceration and lower crime rates. ”We now know with the fullness of time that we made some terrible mistakes,” Travis said. ”And those mistakes were to ramp up the use of prison. And that big mistake is the one that we now, 20 years later, come to grips with. We have to look in the mirror and say, ’look what we have done. ’” Nick Turner of Vera put the human costs even more starkly. ”If you’re a black baby born today, you have a 1 in 3 chance of spending some time in prison or jail,” Turner said. ”If you’re Latino, it’s a 1 in 6 chance. And if you’re white, it’s 1 in 17. And so coming to terms with these disparities and reversing them, I would argue, is not only a matter of fairness and justice but it’s, I would argue, a matter of national security.” Talk to combatants in the long and sometimes nasty debate over the crime bill 20 years ago, and another item on the table back then looks different with hindsight too. It’s a concept known as midnight basketball. Rep. Bobby Scott, a Virginia Democrat, voted against the bill years ago, in part because it didn’t do enough to support prevention programs. In between votes in the Capitol this week, Scott reflected on the debate. ”Midnight basketball was described as paying money so that crackheads could play basketball in the middle of the night,” Scott said. ”What they left out was the fact that every time they put midnight basketball in a neighborhood, the crime rate plummeted. You saved more money than you spent on the midnight basketball. They left that part out.” Funding for the midnight basketball program and other prevention initiatives never fully materialized because of political fights over the bill. But today, ideas like that one win support from Republican governors who have branded their approach as ”Right on Crime.” They’re taking money away from prisons and putting it into social programs. Lately the Obama administration, including Vice President Joe Biden, who was the lead Senate sponsor of that 1994 bill, is embracing those very policies and supporting new legislation to reduce mandatory minimum prison terms.
The cultural, regional and generational roots of spanking	2014-09-16	2014	9	 (CNN) The indictment of NFL star Adrian Peterson on child abuse charges has led to a robust debate about whether hitting, spanking or any other form of corporal punishment is justified and effective in dealing with children. It has also revealed sharp differences in cultural, regional and generational attitudes toward using any kind of physical force to try to teach kids right from wrong. Peterson, through his attorney, has admitted disciplining his    son with a switch    taking an approach to discipline along the lines of what ”he experienced as a child growing up in East Texas,” said the attorney, Rusty Hardin. In a written statement Monday posted on his Twitter feed, the star running back for the Minnesota Vikings touted his parents’ approach as one of the reasons he has reached the professional heights he has. ”Deep in my heart I have always believed I could have been one of those kids that was lost in the streets without the discipline instilled in me by my parents and other relatives,” he wrote. ”I have always believed that the way my parents disciplined me has a great deal to do with the success I have enjoyed as a man.” Adrian Peterson: Not a ’child abuser,’ but sorry about ’hurt I have brought’ to son, Children who are spanked or given other physical punishments like Peterson apparently was when he was a kid are more likely to spank their own kids, said Elizabeth Gershoff, an associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin who has been studying corporal punishment for 15 years. ”We call that intergenerational transmission because our parents are one of our main examples of how to parent,” said Gershoff, known as one of the leading researchers on spanking. ”So parents do what parents did to them and that’s what Adrian Peterson is saying.” Gershoff, who has done a systematic analysis of the hundreds of studies exploring the effects of corporal punishment, said the research shows that spanking is more common among African Americans than among other racial and ethnic groups in the United States, including whites, Latinos and Asian Americans. ”There are people who say it might be a legacy of slavery, which is a very sad thing to think about but it’s possible that having lived for centuries with a culture of violence being kind of (used) against them that they kind of keep it going unfortunately.” Parenting advocate Asadah Kirkland, author of the   book ”Beating Black Kids,” also points to a belief held by some African Americans that using physical force to discipline children helps to protect them from the violence of the wider world. Spanking the gray matter out of our kids, She calls it ”The Beloved Syndrome,” referring to a movie about slavery starring Oprah Winfrey. ”If you remember the movie, Oprah Winfrey actually kills her children because she saw the slave master coming and instead of letting him get them, she ended up killing her own children,” she said. ”That’s drastic but it comes from that mentality, but it’s not real. It’s a myth.” Kirkland, who gives workshops to African Americans encouraging them not to discipline with their hands, said the thinking is that if you beat your children, they will be more prepared for any potential ”beating up” they’ll face in life. ”This is not the boxing match. This is you rearing a child so that they should have certain values and certain skills that they can only have if you give (them) to them.” Former NBA star Charles Barkley added the regional component to the debate over spanking, when he suggested that a ”whipping” is a kind of discipline that many parents in the South ”do all the time.” Jennifer Alsip, a mom of two, said she comes from a white middle class family in Texas that believes in spankings. ”I got ’whooped’ and I ’whooped’ my daughters (when and if they needed it),” she said. ”All I would have to do was threaten to give them a spanking, and they would mind me.”  In Sweden, a generation of kids who’ve never been spanked, Gershoff, the researcher on corporal punishment, said spanking rates are indeed higher in the South than in other parts of the country. Part of that, she said, may be because spanking is more common in families that have a conservative religious background. ”Those parents are more likely to say they have very strong beliefs and their interpretation of the Bible leads them to believe that spanking is a good idea, that they need to do it.” Other factors driving corporal punishment, she said, include age, education and income: Younger parents, parents with lower levels of education and parents from lower income levels are more likely to hit their children. ”Parents with less education may not be aware that there are other ways of disciplining kids,” said Gershoff. Peterson, for his part, indicated he wasn’t familiar with other parenting techniques to use when children misbehave. ”I also understand after meeting with a psychologist that there are other alternative ways of disciplining a child that may be more appropriate,” he said. Awareness is crucial, said Gershoff, comparing spanking to seat belts and car seats. We didn’t have either in the 60s and 70s when parents let their kids bounce around the backs of station wagons. Kids behaving badly: When old rules of discipline no longer apply, ”They thought that was fine but now we know so much more about what happens in car accidents, and you can’t do that anymore,” she said. ”And I think of spanking in the same way. We know so much more now about the kinds of things that hurt kids and the kinds of things that help them that we really shouldn’t spank anymore. We know it’s not a good idea.” The research, according to Gershoff, is conclusive: spanking does not improve behavior, leads to aggression and other behavior problems like stealing and lying, makes it more likely children will have mental health issues such as depression and anxiety and could lead to learning problems at school. It could also lead to child abuse, she said. ”The more parents spank, the more likely they are to physically abuse their children,” said Gershoff. ”And that’s kind of what we see in the Peterson case is that people hit too long or too hard with an object and their intention is to discipline the kid but they’re hurting them because they’re hitting so hard.” To spank or not to spank: Where do you draw the line? Despite all the research we have now on spanking and other forms of corporal punishment, for parents who were spanked a lot as kids, it can be tough not to use it as a form of discipline. Micky Morrison    a mom of two, author and founder of BabyWeightTV    said she grew up in rural Tennessee where spanking was the norm.  ”Interestingly, probably because I was spanked as a child, spanking was often my first reaction to a stressful parenting situation. It’s taken a lot of reprogramming to not repeat that pattern,” she said. Do you think spanking is an effective form of discipline? Tell Kelly Wallace on Twitter or CNN Living on Facebook.
The Song That Never Ends: Why Earth, Wind & Fire’s ’September’ Sustains	2014-09-19	2014	9	If you’ve ever been to a wedding reception in the U. S. you know there’s one question that can get a whole family on the dance floor: ”Do you remember the 21st night of September?” Earth, Wind  Fire’s ”September” even shows up at fictional weddings, as in the opening of the 1997 movie Soul Food. It’s made its way into TV shows, commercials, sporting events and video games. HBO named a movie after the song. In 2008, it played at both the Republican and Democratic national conventions. The story of the song begins in 1978. Allee Willis was a struggling songwriter in LA  —   until the night she got a call from Maurice White, the leader of Earth, Wind  Fire. White offered her the chance of a lifetime: to   the band’s next album. Willis arrived at the studio the next day hoping it wasn’t some kind of cosmic joke. ”As I open the door, they had just written the intro to ’September.’ And I just thought, ’Dear God, let this be what they want me to write!’ Cause it was obviously the   song in the world,” Willis says. Using a progression composed by Earth, Wind  Fire guitarist Al McKay, White and Willis wrote the song over the course of a month, conjuring images of clear skies and dancing under the stars. Willis says she likes songs that tell stories, and that at a certain point, she feared the lyrics to ”September” were starting to sound simplistic. One nonsense phrase bugged her in particular. ”The, kind of,   phrase that Maurice used in every song he wrote was ’ ’ ” she says. ”So right from the beginning he was singing, ’   say, do you remember      dancing in September.’ And I said, ’We are going to change ’  ’ to real words, right?’ ” Wrong. Willis says that at the final vocal session she got desperate and begged White to rewrite the part. ”And finally, when it was so obvious that he was not going to do it, I just said, ’What the       does ’  ’ mean?’ And he essentially said, ’Who the       cares? ’” she says. ”I learned my greatest lesson ever in songwriting from him, which was never let the lyric get in the way of the groove.” I asked Jeffrey Peretz, a professor of music theory at New York University’s Clive Davis Institute, what makes that groove so powerful. He says a lot of it has to do with how the music unfolds. The song’s very structure is an endless cycle that keeps us dancing and wanting more. ”There’s four chords in the chorus that just keep moving forward and never seem to land anywhere  —   much like the four seasons,” he says. ”It’s the end of summer, it’s the beginning of fall, it’s that Indian summertime, it’s the transition from warm to cool.” The trigger for that yearning feeling, Peretz says, is the opening line. White asks, ”Do you remember?” and we supply the memories. It’s a song that can bring all of the generations together, which makes it perfect for family gatherings. The true meaning is up to us  —   including, Allee Willis says, that strangely specific date. ”We went through all the dates: ’Do you remember the first, the second, the third, the fourth . .. ’ and the one that just felt the best was the 21st,” Willis explains. ”I constantly have people coming up to me and they get so excited to know what the significance was. And there is no significance beyond it just sang better than any of the other dates. So . .. sorry!” That’s OK, Allee. Maurice was right. It doesn’t matter what it means. When we hear it, it’s September 21st, and we are dancing again with our family, in a song that never really ends.
What we can learn from the tattoos of our ancestors	2014-09-22	2014	9	 (CNN) Eight thousand years ago, a pencil mustache was tattooed onto the upper lip of a young Peruvian man. His mummified body has since become the oldest existing example of tattoo art on the planet. Today’s world is, of course, almost unrecognizable by comparison. But according to Professor Nicholas Thomas, Director of the Museum of Archeology and Anthropology at Cambridge University    author of a new book about body art    the tattoo has made a powerful comeback. ”There has been an extraordinary, epochal change in the last 25 years,” he says. ”When I was a child in the 1960s, we didn’t see tattoos everywhere. But there has been an explosion in popularity, and this tells us a lot about who we are, both culturally and as individuals.” In fact, according to some studies, up to 38% of Americans and a fifth of British adults have some type of   body art.  Many interlocking factors have a bearing on the popularity of the tattoo. Foremost among them is a change in the popular conception of the body. ”Because of advances in technology and medical science, people no longer understand the body as something natural that you’re born with and live with. Instead, we understand it much more as something that is changeable and mutable,” says Professor Thomas. ”People have all sorts of surgical interventions, medical and cosmetic. It is even possible to change your gender. This means that we now see our body as something we have a responsibility to design and make. Even something as simple as a fitness routine or a tan indicates this attitude.” Read: Society isn’t quite ready for facial tattoos, A permanent stamp of identity, In addition, as global mobility leads to the increasing pluralization of society, identity is also being seen as something to be designed rather than inherited. ”People are no longer simply British or Australian or Californian,” he says. ”Our identities are far more particular, linked to our interests, affinities to cultural or spiritual traditions, tastes in music, and subcultural allegiances. The tattoo has become a vehicle for that sort of particular identification.” The recent surge in popularity for tattooing started in the California   scene of the Sixties and Seventies. During the 20th Century, tattoos had become associated with criminals, sailors and members of the military, who had become dislocated from mainstream society and wanted to stamp a commemoration of that experience on their bodies. The Californians took that trend and subverted it, inventing their own designs and viewing body ink as an art form rather than a type of social branding. More recently, there’s been a return to traditional forms of tribal tattoos. Ancient Celtic designs, or those originating in the Pacific Islands, provide inspiration for a great number of body ink enthusiasts (although it remains unusual to see a young man with a tattoo of a pencil mustache). In the past, however, tattoos were not used to form individual identities. Instead they tended to be a collective cultural project, constituting particular social markers. Sometimes they created a spectacular appearance when a tribe all shared the same design in other instances, they were used as initiation or    rites. ”In Samoa, men have elaborate tattoos inked on their thighs, buttocks and lower chest,” says Professor Thomas. ”It is a painful ordeal that requires a man to submit to the authority of the elders. When he emerges, he is celebrated as a hero.” Read: Tattoos and piercings: How young is too young? Tattoos and individualism, The Samoans, and many other traditional communities, saw having a tattoo as an important process rather than a possession. The whole body was tattooed at once, and it was rarely supplemented. By contrast, the modern tattoo enthusiast tends to view them as an expanding collection that creates permanent markers of important moments in an individual’s life. ”Globalization is exposing us to a whole range of traditions from many places,” Professor Thomas says. ”Body art is becoming the opposite of conformity, a sort of badge of travel, or internationalism. People visit places and make them parts of themselves, so that they will forever bear marks of their unique visit.” As Jonny Depp once put it, ”My body is my journal and my tattoos are my story”. But does this indicate an underlying cultural anxiety? Are we literally growing less comfortable in our own skin? ”That’s part of it,” says Professor Thomas. ”As the world opens up culturally and economically, there are fewer certainties than there ever were before, and far more multiplicity. So people are trying to invent themselves, and make it permanent.” Often, he continues, people who feel that a spiritual dimension is missing in contemporary Western life may be attracted to the spiritual symbols of traditional cultures around the world, which are often ”understood naively in terms of spirituality”. Read: Suffering from ’tattoo regret’ The Christian approach towards tattoos, The decline of Christianity in the West has also had a degree of influence on the rise of the tattoo. Some streams of Christianity have condemned body art due to the perceived sanctity of the body. But this is far from universal. During the Renaissance, for example, European devotees who went on pilgrimage to the Holy Land often had tattoos of Christian symbols or scenes to commemorate the experience. Many were carried out by the Razzouk family in the Old City of Jerusalem (members of that family are still carrying out the service today). But whatever your type of tattoo, research has shown that it profoundly alters the way in which you will be perceived. Adults with tattoos have been shown to be more sexually active to engage in riskier behavior and to have stronger   and   though this sharply declined in women three weeks after the tattoo. Moreover, academic studies of first impressions of people with tattoos have revealed that they were expected to have had more sexual partners, be less inhibited, and to be probable  . Whether tattoos are the cause or the effect of such personality types is a moot point. But one thing is certain: given that the fragmentation and diversification of modern life shows no sign of reducing, body art is going to be here to stay.

The federal drug scheduling system, explained	2014-09-25	2014	9	 The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has announced its decision: It will keep marijuana in the same legal, regulatory category as heroin  —   schedule 1.    To many people, this is outrageous. Obviously, marijuana is nowhere as dangerous as heroin. And it’s not more dangerous than schedule 2 drugs like cocaine and meth. So why the hell is pot schedule 1? But the classification doesn’t mean that the federal government thinks of marijuana and heroin as equally dangerous drugs. The schedule reflects a more complicated system  —   one that accounts for a drug’s medical value as much as a drug’s potential for abuse. A harsh schedule also does not mean a drug is totally illegal. Criminal laws, while guided by the scheduling system, often take other factors into account. For pot, they do  —   leaving it as one of the   illicit drugs at the federal level, even though it’s schedule 1. And opioid painkillers, as one example, are schedule 2 but legal for medical purposes.    Still, a drug’s schedule is an important policy guide. A stricter schedule lets the DEA more stringently limit access to a drug and its supply, which can make a drug more difficult to research  —   as has happened for marijuana, limiting researchers’ ability to study the drug for its medical value. (As a result, advocacy and medical groups have long contended that pot’s schedule is out of step with the available scientific evidence.)     So what is the scheduling system, how does it work, and what would it take to reschedule a drug? Here’s what you need to know. How does the US classify illicit drugs like marijuana?              Under the Controlled Substances Act, the federal government  —   which has largely relegated the regulation of drugs to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)  —   puts each drug into a classification, known as a schedule, based on its medical value and potential for abuse.    To initiate a schedule, the DEA first asks if a drug can be abused. If the answer is yes, then it’s put on a schedule. If no, the drug is left out. After that, the drug’s medical value and relative potential for abuse are evaluated to decide where on the scale it lands. Congress did not clearly define abuse under the Controlled Substances Act The two big issues, then, are a drug’s potential for abuse and its medical value. Congress did not clearly define abuse under the Controlled Substances Act. But for federal agencies responsible for classifying drugs, abuse is when individuals take a substance recreationally and develop personal health hazards or pose other risks to society as a whole. To find medical value, a drug must have   clinical trials to back it up  —   similar to what the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would expect from any other drug entering the market.    Schedule 1 drugs have no medical value and high potential for abuse, while schedule 2 through 5 substances all have some medical value but differ in ranking depending on their potential for abuse (from high to low). Some examples of the drugs that are on each schedule:  Schedule 1: marijuana, heroin, LSD, ecstasy, and magic mushrooms  Schedule 2: cocaine, meth, oxycodone, Adderall, Ritalin, and Vicodin  Schedule 3: Tylenol with codeine, ketamine, anabolic steroids, and testosterone  Schedule 4: Xanax, Soma, Darvocet, Valium, and Ambien  Schedule 5: Robitussin AC, Lomotil, Motofen, Lyrica, and Parepectolin  In general, schedule 1 and 2 drugs have the most regulatory restrictions on research, supply, and access, and schedule 5 drugs have the least. Does the federal government really consider marijuana more dangerous than cocaine?              To many people, one of the more bewildering aspects of the scheduling system is that marijuana is schedule 1  —   the same category as heroin  —   while cocaine and meth are schedule 2. But that doesn’t necessarily mean the federal government views marijuana and heroin as equally dangerous drugs, or that it considers marijuana to be more dangerous than meth or cocaine. Schedule 1 and 2 drugs are both described as having ”a high potential for abuse”  —   a vague description that doesn’t rank drugs in the two categories as equal or different. The big distinction between schedule 1 and 2 substances, instead, is whether the federal government thinks a drug has medical value. The DEA says schedule 2 substances have some medical value and schedule 1 substances do not, so the latter receive more regulatory scrutiny even though they may not be more dangerous.    The war on drugs was initiated when much of the nation was in hysterics about what drugs would do to the moral fabric of the country It may be helpful to think of the scheduling system as made up of two distinct groups: nonmedical and medical. The nonmedical group comprises the schedule 1 drugs, which are considered to have no medical value and high potential for abuse. The medical group comprises the schedule 2 to 5 drugs, which have some medical value and are numerically ranked  based on abuse potential. There are some cultural considerations to the scheduling system, as well. The war on drugs was initiated at a time  when much of the nation was  in hysterics about what drugs like  marijuana and LSD would do to the  moral fabric of the country. Marijuana  was seen as dangerous not  necessarily because of its direct health effects, but because of  the  perception  —   partially  rooted in racial prejudices  —   that pot makes people immoral, lazy, and even  violent. This  perception persists among many supporters of the war on  drugs to this  day, and it’s still reflected in America’s drug  scheduling. Beyond the scheduling system, the federal government imposes criminal trafficking penalties for drugs that don’t always align with their scheduling. For instance, marijuana  trafficking is generally punished less severely than cocaine. And state governments can set up their own criminal penalties and schedules for drugs as well. Why does a drug’s schedule matter?              A drug’s schedule sets the groundwork for the federal regulation of a controlled substance. Schedule 1 and 2 drugs face the strictest regulations. Schedule 1 drugs are effectively illegal for anything outside of research, and schedule 2 drugs can be used for limited medical purposes with the DEA’s approval  —   for example, through a license for prescriptions.    The DEA even sets strict limits on the production of schedule 1 and 2 drugs, although the limits vary from drug to drug. Only one place in the US  —   a University of Mississippi farm  —   is currently allowed to grow marijuana under federal regulations, and the pot is limited to research purposes. By comparison, several private companies produce oxycodone, a schedule 2 substance, and use the drug for prescription painkillers. A drug’s schedule can interfere with state laws A drug’s schedule can interfere with state laws. Marijuana’s schedule 1 status is one reason banks are reluctant to open accounts for pot shops and growers in Colorado and Washington, even though the businesses are legal under state law. Federal tax law also prohibits businesses from deducting many expenses related to the trafficking of schedule 1 and 2 drugs, which can cause   marijuana businesses’ effective income tax rates to soar as high as 90 percent. The DEA sometimes uses marijuana’s classification to pressure physicians, hospitals, and pharmacies into not working with  medical marijuana operations that are compliant with state law. If these medical providers don’t comply, the DEA threatens to take back licensing that lets doctors prescribe drugs, such as prescription painkillers with oxycodone, that contain scheduled substances. What does it take to reschedule a drug?              Congress could pass a law that changes or restricts a drug’s schedule. But Congress mostly leaves scheduling to federal agencies like the DEA. (One exception: Congress previously passed the Hillory J. Farias and Samantha Reid   Prevention Act of 2000 and added gamma hydroxybutyric acid, a date rape drug, to the scheduling system.) The US attorney general can also initiate a review process that would look at the available evidence and potentially change a drug’s schedule. The review includes several steps:     The DEA, US Department of Health and Human Services, or public petition initiate a review. The DEA requests HHS to review the medical and scientific evidence regarding a drug’s schedule. HHS, through the FDA, evaluates the drug and its schedule through an analysis based on eight factors. Among the factors: a drug’s potential for abuse, the scientific evidence for a drug’s pharmacological effects, and the scientific evidence for a drug’s medical use. HHS recommends a schedule based on the scientific evidence. The DEA conducts its own review, with the HHS’s determination in mind, and sets the final schedule.  Although very rigorous, this process has been successfully carried out in the past. For example, the DEA in 2014 announced it had rescheduled hydrocodone combination products, or    prescription painkillers, from schedule 3 to schedule 2. ”Almost 7  million Americans abuse   prescription  medications,   including opioid painkillers, resulting in more deaths  from  prescription drug  overdoses than auto accidents,” former DEA head Michele Leonhart said in a 2014 statement. ”Today’s action recognizes that  these  products are some of the most addictive  and potentially  dangerous  prescription medications available.” Can a drug be unscheduled?              It’s possible, but it’s much more difficult than simply rescheduling a drug. One big hurdle is international treaties. The US is party to international agreements that effectively require some drugs, including marijuana, to remain within the scheduling system  —   and possibly schedule 1 or 2. Proving that a drug has no potential for abuse is also very difficult, if not impossible. An American Scientist analysis, for instance, found even relatively safe marijuana has some potential for dependence; it’s less addictive than heroin, meth, cocaine, nicotine, and alcohol, but more addictive than hallucinogens such as LSD, which doesn’t cause much, if any, dependence. And since pot is widely used recreationally, that makes it a sure   for ”high potential for abuse.” The two major recreational drugs not on the scheduling system  —   alcohol and tobacco  —   required a specific exemption in the Controlled Substances Act. Mark Kleiman, a drug policy expert, argues both would be marked schedule 1 if they were evaluated today, since they’re widely used recreationally, addictive, detrimental to one’s health and society, and deadly.    Why is marijuana still schedule 1?              When marijuana’s classification comes under review, its schedule 1 status is consistently maintained due to insufficient scientific evidence of its medical value. Specifically, the scientific evidence available for marijuana doesn’t pass the threshold required by federal agencies to acknowledge a drug’s potential as medicine. No studies proved the drug’s medical efficacy in controlled,   clinical environments. No studies established adequate safety protocols for marijuana. And marijuana’s full chemical structure has never been characterized and analyzed. There have been some studies showing marijuana has medical benefits, particularly for pain and muscle stiffness. But these studies haven’t been large enough to meet the threshold the DEA and other federal agencies, such as the FDA, require to prove a drug has medical value  —   by proving its worth in controlled,   clinical trials. Changing marijuana’s schedule is a bit of a   But one reason there isn’t enough scientific evidence to change marijuana’s schedule 1 status might be, in fact, the drug’s schedule 1 status. The DEA restricts how much marijuana can go to research. To obtain legal marijuana supplies for studies, researchers must get their studies approved by HHS, the FDA, and the DEA. Changing marijuana’s schedule, in other words, is a bit of a  . There needs to be a certain level of scientific research that proves marijuana has medical value, but the federal government’s restrictions make it difficult to conduct that research.    To address those issues, the DEA hopes to allow much more research into pot in other ways. For one, it’s increased the amount of pot grown for research over the past few years, and it plans to continue doing so. Crucially, it also plans to let more people and facilities grow marijuana for studies  —   aside from University of Mississippi, the only federally legal grower right now. That could significantly open up research access to pot  —   including potentially   marijuana and different strains of the drug, which the University of Mississippi doesn’t currently meet demands for. But the effects of the changes remain to be seen. While a reclassification would be a symbolic win for legalization advocates, Kleiman says it wouldn’t have much practical effect. Schedule 2 substances typically require a prescription to be distributed, and the   marijuana dispensaries and retail outlets don’t work through traditional prescriptions (they distribute ”recommendations” for medical marijuana)  —   so even rescheduling may not open up access. (Cocaine and meth are schedule 2, and they’re definitely not easily legally available, after all.)      Still, if the federal government acknowledged pot’s medical value through a schedule 2 classification, advocates hoped it would make federal agencies far more receptive to paying for and approving medical research into pot. But the DEA hopes its other steps will unlock far more research instead. There would be some effects on policy, such as allowing   marijuana business to deduct certain taxes, if marijuana was reclassified to schedule 3 or lower. But that’s extremely unlikely: Schedule 3 and lower drugs need to have some medical value and not meet criteria for ”high potential for abuse.” Since marijuana is widely used recreationally, it’s a   for ”high potential for abuse,” keeping it at schedule 1 or 2. Is there an alternative to the scheduling system?              Kleiman has proposed moving to a scheduling system that looks only at a drug’s potential for abuse without considering whether it has medical value. The regime would control all intoxicating drugs, including alcohol, to try to prevent problematic drug use, based on the scientific definition of drug abuse disorders. Whether a drug has medical value would be addressed by a different set of policies focused on medical drug production and health care.    ”Whether something is medication is a separate set of issues,” Kleiman said. His ideal system ”would classify drugs by dangerousness, with a penalties for dealing ramping up with more dangerous drugs.” ”The current prohibition system has generated many bad side effects” One of the problems with the current scheduling system, Kleiman argued, is it tries to lump drugs with completely different effects and risks into a few categories. ”There are lots of different drugs in the world, and we have to figure out what to do with each of them,” Kleiman said. ”Some categorization is helpful, but it’s not as if the drugs neatly break down.” Kleiman, who supports decriminalizing illicit drug use and legalizing marijuana, said an ideal replacement to the current scheduling system would also come with less stringent criminal penalties. ”The current prohibition system has generated many bad side effects,” Kleiman said. ”We should try to develop new policies that duplicate the success of preventing the development of more drugs that are as big a problem as alcohol, but with fewer of the costs.” The war on drugs, explained     Watch: America’s opioid epidemic, explained    
New Mexico police catch a ’ghost’ on camera	2014-09-26	2014	9	    Next time you see a ghost, ‘who you gonna call?’ For those who live in Espanola, New Mexico, it won’t be Bill Murray and his fellow Ghostbusters, but instead the local police department. On Sept. 20, Officer Karl Romero of the Espanola Police Department was on duty watching surveillance video from around the station when he spotted something strange. What he saw spooked him. In the surveillance footage, a foggy figure is seen moving through a parking lot and through a secured gate. “At first I thought it was a fly, a moth, and then I saw the legs and it was a human,” Romero told KOAT. While not entirely clear, the object in the video that moves across the screen appears to be walking. Skeptics might raise their eyebrows at Romero’s claims that the shape on the screen is something otherworldly, but it is the kind of spectral presence that Detective Solomon Romero said is not out of the ordinary at the station. “A lot of officers have seen certain things,” Det. Romero said. “Some officers have felt someone breathing down their necks as they’re working in the briefing room. ” For those who have watched movies like “Poltergeist,” the question of whether or not the station is built over ancient burial grounds immediately comes up. KOAT reports that the department, which has been at this location since 2006, is not standing over any hallowed ground and no inmates have ever died on the premises. That being said, those who work at the station have their fair share of   stories. Many of the officers have reported hearing unusual noises in the middle of the night as well as seeing strange images in the building’s lobby that can’t be easily explained. Just in time for Halloween season, these unexplained sightings have left many at the station rattled. Is the image in the video a speck of dust, or a visitor from the ‘beyond?’ For Det. Romero, at least, the answer is clear. “I do believe in ghosts,” Det. Romero said, adding that “we’ve had some unsolved murders in the area. ” 
Friends was a great show — that just happened to ruin TV comedy	2014-09-29	2014	9	 You probably remember Friends as one of the best comedies of its era, a megahit that nonetheless possessed warm, funny, relatable characters and a surprisingly soapy storytelling style. It spawned hairstyles, catchphrases, and Ross and Rachel, perhaps the definitive   ’  relationship of the ’90s.    Friends turned 20 in 2014, and that meant the usual round of nostalgic roundups and think pieces about the show (including a couple that suggested it wasn’t worth all the hype). Even more of these pieces followed when the show hit Netflix in early 2015. And now NBC has announced an official Friends ”reunion” of sorts, something that many fans of the show have been clamoring for for years. There are plenty of reasons to be skeptical: Not only are the details on said reunion scarce, but it’s technically part of a   special honoring director James Burrows, who helmed many of the series’ episodes over the course of its   run. What’s more, the only thing we know for certain is that all six members of the main cast  —   Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry, and David Schwimmer  —   will appear onscreen at some point during the special, which is scheduled to air February 21. There’s no guarantee they’ll even be in character, let alone share a scene.    ”I’m hoping all six of them will be all in the same room at the same time, but I’m not sure if we can logistically pull that off,” Bob Greenblatt, NBC’s chair of entertainment, said when he made the announcement at the Television Critics Association winter press tour in Pasadena.     But even if the Friends cast does indeed reconvene for some sort of reunion, scripted or otherwise, missing in much of this is a key piece of information: Friends ruined the TV comedy for a good long while. And it’s only just starting to put itself back together. Pretty people being funny Okay, okay, if we’re being specific, then the executives who kept trying to copy Friends ruined the TV comedy. Really, Friends can’t be blamed here. All it did was exist and become extremely popular. At its best, the show was a blast of fresh air, and even when it wasn’t very good, it was fun to hang around with the talented ensemble cast week after week.    But perhaps because Friends became one of the last, true TV megahits, executives decided that, hey, they should copy the show. How hard could it be? Since this was television, where copycats usually are blurry Xeroxes, they copied only the most superficial things about the show, which has happened to many a series. But what was weird about the copying of Friends is that it persists to this day, more than a decade after the show went off the air. Networks can’t get it out of their heads that making a new Friends should be incredibly easy, and in the case of How I Met Your Mother, they actually kinda succeeded. (Really, though, HIMYM owes as much to the British   Coupling and its inventive narrative trickery as it does the original. But that’s another article.) It’s hard enough to find funny people. Once you place the restriction of also having those funny people be attractive, it gets even harder.    Take, for instance, the makeup of the Friends cast. All six cast members were ridiculously attractive and funny actors, to boot. Conventional TV wisdom up to that point had been that pretty people struggled to be funny, and if you look at the sitcom casts of previous eras, they rarely had more than a couple of conventionally attractive folks in them. Even in the case of, say, Ted Danson and Shelley Long of Cheers, both actors were   to be sure, but they were also just a little bit, shall we say, quirky, too. Nobody’s trying to disparage anybody in the cast of Friends here. They all became stars in their own right, and both Jennifer Aniston and Lisa Kudrow won Emmys for their work on the show (and rightly so). It’s simply to say that it’s hard enough to find funny people. Once you place the restriction of also having those funny people be attractive people, it gets even harder. Or, as longtime comedy writer Ken Levine (who wrote for both M. A. S. H. and Cheers among his many, many other credits) put it on his blog in a post about how Friends has made executives long for ensemble comedies about young, attractive singles: ”I’ve always believed that for comedies you cast the funniest people. And often times those are not the most attractive. Today that would probably result in a big fight.” Rise of the   Make a list of the biggest hit comedies of the past 20 years. Friends will be on there, of course, but so will Everybody Loves Raymond and Two and a Half Men. So will The Office and Modern Family. And so will current champ, The Big Bang Theory. Yet outside of Modern Family (itself already a ”family sitcom,” the most generic sitcom format of them all) how many of these shows have inspired legions of copycats to this day? Most of them haven’t. But Friends has. Shows attempting to be the new Friends march on and off the schedule every TV season with clockwork regularity. Now I (and most TV fans) would probably welcome another Friends long before we’d welcome another Two and a Half Men. But it’s just weird that TV keeps tossing out parades of single   and   in an attempt to copy a show that left the air 10 years ago. Granted, the success of HIMYM gave the format new life just when it might have started flagging, but even the shows that last past their first season  —   the New Girls and Happy Endings of the world  —   settle into a   state fairly quickly. That disproportionate focus on one particular type of comedy chokes out lots of other promising types    But most of these shows are just awful. You won’t remember most of them, because they came and went so quickly, but TV keeps trying to make them happen. Even in the most recent TV season, there were NBC’s A to Z (which sold itself as a forthright spin on HIMYM, actually, making it a copy of a copy of a copy, if you’re following the lineage) and Marry Me (which at least had a few older characters in its ensemble, though it was primarily quirky young folks) to say nothing of Fox’s Mulaney (which sold itself as a new spin on Seinfeld but still has tons of Friends in its DNA). That disproportionate focus on one particular type of comedy chokes out lots of other promising types. And there’s something else the three shows above have in common  —   they all quickly flopped, the fate of so many Friends clones. Worse, the ”singles bouncing in and out of love” genre has a tendency to immediately devolve into a conflictless ”hangout sitcom,” the sort of show that rarely pushes its characters beyond the most   tension. Comedy thrives on conflict, and the hangout sitcom needs to deflate it, lest we wonder why these people hang out together. But Friends will remain eternally alluring to network executives. As Jaime Weinman, an associate editor for Canada’s Maclean’s magazine and one of the world’s foremost experts in TV comedy, puts it, the format of the show promises something they love: youth. ”The theme of Friends is what people do when they’re not kids anymore, but don’t quite feel or act like they’re adults yet. You can sell that idea because that’s a demographic that networks and advertisers are always trying to reach,” Weinman told me. ”Writers want to pitch that idea because writers often feel stuck in that limbo between college and adulthood themselves, no matter how old they are.” Ross and Rachel and Monica and Chandler For all of the ways that TV executives’ hunger to find the new Friends hurt broadcast TV comedy for many years, it also had at least one surprisingly beneficial effect  —   Friends solidified the idea of comedies having   story arcs, with the success of its romances between Ross and Rachel and between Monica and Chandler.    Friends’ greatest structural innovation was in taking the   ’  structure Cheers had deployed so successfully and pushing it into the territory of the primetime soap. When done well, it gave viewers something to come back week after week to see  —   and the network big moments to promote. And that has been influential on nearly every comedy that airs on the screen today. ”Now we expect character relationships to be constantly evolving” Go back to that list of big comedy hits. All of them have   story arcs that reach resolution very, very, very slowly. And while Cheers paved the way for that, Friends proved that people would sometimes come back just for the romance, or for the characters’ career travails, or even for fights between roommates. That’s allowed for TV sitcoms to tackle more ambitious story structures, and it’s led to a landscape where everybody pretty much expects there to be continuing story elements in a sitcom, a marked contrast with the history of the medium. At first, executives forced these stories onto sitcom showrunners, but now they’re simply a part of the genre’s language. ”For better or worse, the basic idea of the sitcom since its inception  —   that most of the characters are basically in the same place all the time, and so are their relationships  —   was threatened by Cheers but really demolished by Friends,” said Weinman. ”Now we expect character relationships to be constantly evolving, to the point that we’re surprised if characters don’t get together and break up multiple times during a run.” All of this is, of course, an exercise in ridiculousness. Friends’ outsize influence has as much to do with the slow collapse of network television (and executives pining for the era when a show could be that big) as it does with anything the show itself did. And the success of How I Met Your Mother proves that with the right cast and right writers, this format can still be amazingly funny and successful.       But we too often think of TV shows as discrete units, things that run for a while, then go off the air and appear in TV Land reruns. Really, however, TV is perhaps the medium most influenced by the other shows that are already on it  —   whether in reaction to those shows or in embracing what they do so well. Friends might have left the air in 2004, but it also never really did. The seeds of its influence are sprouting all around us.

Yoko Ono Fast Facts	2014-10-08	2014	10	 (CNN) Here’s a look at the life of artist, musician and   activist Yoko Ono.  Personal:Birth date: February 18, 1933, Birth place: Tokyo, Japan, Birth name: Ono Yōko (in Japanese) Father: Yeisuke Ono, bank executive (also spelled Eisuke) Mother: Isoko (Yasuda) Ono, Marriages: John Lennon (March 20,   8, 1980, his death) Anthony Cox (  divorced) Ichiyanagi Toshi (  divorced) Children: with John Lennon: Sean Lennon, October 9, 1975 with Anthony Cox: Kyoko Cox, 1963, Education: Attended Gakushuin University in Tokyo and Sarah Lawrence College in New York, Other Facts:Her full name is Yoko Ono Lennon. As a child, Ono moved back and forth between Japan and the United States. During World War II, she was in Tokyo during an air raid on the city in March 1945.  She was the first woman ever admitted into the philosophy program at Gakushuin University. Was a part of the New York   scene and the Fluxus movement, which was founded by conceptual artist George Maciunas, and included La Monte Young, Diane Wakoski and Walter De Maria.  As of 2017, Ono has fought the parole of her husband’s convicted killer, Mark David Chapman, nine times, out of concern for her personal safety.  Has won two Grammy Awards, one as an artist and producer (1981) and the other as a video producer (2000). Timeline:Early 1960s   Ono and La Monte Young stage a series of events in a loft on Chambers Street in Manhattan. Ono’s works are also experienced at Carnegie Recital Hall, Village Gate and various galleries in New York.  1962   Returns to Japan, and  is committed to a mental hospital for clinical depression.  Mid 1960s   Lecturer at Wesleyan College.  1964   Premieres ”Cut Piece,” which involves the audience cutting off pieces of Ono’s clothing until she is naked.  1966   Premieres ”No. 4 (Bottoms),” a short film featuring a series of   of nude buttocks.  November 1966   Ono meets John Lennon when he visits her art exhibit in London.  October 18, 1968   Ono and John Lennon are arrested in London for possession of cannabis. In court the following month, Lennon admits possession and is fined £150. Ono’s charges are dropped.  November 1968   Ono and John Lennon release the album ”Two Virgins,” featuring a controversial nude photo of them on the cover.  March   1969   During their honeymoon, Ono and Lennon stage their first ” ” in their Amsterdam hotel room to promote world peace.  September 1969   Ono performs with the Plastic Ono Band (which includes Lennon, Eric Clapton, Alan White and Klaus Voormann) and subsequently releases ”Live Peace in Toronto, 1969.” December 11, 1970   Ono and Lennon release ”Plastic Ono Band” solo LPs on the same day.  Late 1971   During a custody battle, Ono’s   film producer Tony Cox, disappears with their    daughter, Kyoko. After traveling to Texas, then California, Cox and Kyoko join the religious organization The Walk, also known as the Church of the Living Word. Cox later calls The Walk ”a   cult.” November 1980   Ono and Lennon release ”Double Fantasy.” December 8, 1980   Mark David Chapman, a deranged fan, shoots and kills Lennon in front of the Dakota hotel, where he and Ono live. Ono is a few feet away during the shooting. December 1980   Ono receives a telegram from Cox and Kyoko offering condolences for Lennon’s death. This is the last communication Ono receives from her daughter for years.  1981   Ono releases ”Season of Glass,” a solo LP with a picture of Lennon’s bloodied glasses worn the night of his assassination on the cover.   November 1982   Releases ”It’s Alright (I See Rainbows).”  January 27, 1984   Lennon and Ono’s album, ”Milk and Honey,” is released.

Here’s what 9,000 years of breeding has done to corn, peaches, and other crops	2014-10-15	2014	10	 Fruits and vegetables have changed a lot since the onset of agriculture 10, 000 years ago, as generation after generation of farmers artificially bred crops to select for more desirable traits like size and taste.    But that change can be hard to visualize. So James Kennedy, a chemistry teacher in Australia, created some terrific infographics to show just how drastic the evolution has been. This one, for instance, shows how corn has changed in the last 9, 000 years  —   from a wild grass in the early Americas known as teosinte to the plump ears of corn we know today: The evolution of corn           (James Kennedy) The evolution of corn (maize) is a fascinating story. For a long time, scientists couldn’t figure out where domesticated corn originally came from  —   it doesn’t look like anything that grows in the wild. It took serious sleuthing by geneticists, botanists, and archaeologists to figure out that maize split off from teosinte grass some 9, 000 years ago. (The two are surprisingly similar at the DNA level, differing by just a handful of genes.) As maize became domesticated in Mesoamerica, it was radically altered through selective breeding. Early farmers would examine their plants and save the seeds of those that were larger or tastier, or whose kernels were easier to grind. By 4000 BC, cobs were already an inch long. Within just a few thousand years, cobs had grown to many times that size. Later on, plant hybridization became an important breeding method to further cultivate certain traits.    Nowadays, corn is grown all over the planet, and humans are still making changes using more advanced breeding techniques. In the 1980s, for instance, seed companies turned to genetic engineering  —   so, for instance, scientists inserted genes from Bt soil bacteria into corn to help the plant ward off pests. And some researchers are hoping to develop corn varieties that can withstand drought.    The evolution of watermelon           (James Kennedy) Here’s another great graphic from Kennedy.   watermelons don’t look anything like their distant ancestors from Southern Africa. That, too, is the result of thousands of years of breeding. Yet a few of the biggest advances also came in the United States in the 1950s and 1960s, when crop scientists helped breed varieties that were resistant to disease and had a thicker rind  —   allowing watermelons to be grown all over the country. Even to this day, we’re still producing new types of watermelon  —   like the black Densuke watermelon grown in Japan. And crop scientists have produced seedless watermelons by adding chemicals to double a watermelon’s chromosomes and then breeding the result with a normal watermelon.*    The evolution of peaches           (James Kennedy) And here are peaches, which started out in China and were selected for size and juiciness over thousands of years. Note that the water content of peaches has changed drastically in just 6, 000 years. Mind you, not all attempts at selective breeding turn out so well. As Sarah Yager recently wrote at the Atlantic, apple growers in the United States during the 20th century tried to breed Red Delicious apples to be as bright and shiny as possible and stay on shelves for as long as possible without noticeable bruising. The result? ”As genes for beauty were favored over those for taste, the skins grew tough and bitter around mushy,   flesh.” Nowadays, as storage and transport have become more advanced, tastier apple varieties like the Honeycrisp or Gala are surpassing the Red Delicious.

Saudi court sentences iconic Shiite cleric to death, sparking fears of unrest in kingdom	2014-10-15	2014	10	 The brother of a   Shiite cleric says the sheik has been sentenced to death by a court in Saudi Arabia. Sheik Nimr  ’s brother, Mohammed   announced the verdict Wednesday on Twitter. He also wrote that the family would release a statement with more details. He had told The Associated Press earlier Wednesday that he would be in the courtroom for the verdict. He could not be immediately reached again for comment. Shiite activist Jaafar   in eastern Saudi Arabia says the verdict appears to have been handed down for criminal offenses over the ”incitement” of Shiite protests in Saudi Arabia and neighboring Bahrain. He says there is concern that the death sentence of the revered    cleric will spark anger and renewed protests by the kingdom’s minority Shiites.
Warning: this Parkinson’s drug can make you addicted to gambling, sex, or food	2014-10-20	2014	10	 In 1998, a West Virginia high school teacher named Ann Klinestiver was prescribed a drug called Requip to treat the tremors she suffered from due to Parkinson’s disease.    The drug worked, curing her tremors. But eventually something strange happened: Klinestiver, who’d never been a gambler, suddenly became an obsessive slot machine player. She’d spend 18 hours at a time playing the slots, neglecting all other responsibilities. She lost $250, 000 and separated from her husband before she was taken off the drug in 2004  —   at which point her gambling obsession disappeared within a week. THIS ANALYSIS PROVIDES COMPELLING EVIDENCE THAT THE DRUGS ARE TO BLAME  Her doctors suspected this wasn’t a coincidence. In the years since, hundreds of other patients that were put on Requip and other dopamine agonists (also prescribed for restless leg syndrome) have been observed to suddenly develop extreme gambling problems, drug addictions, sexual urges, and other habits classified as impulse control disorders.    For any one patient, it’s very hard to determine whether this kind of behavior is really the result of the drug or something that might have occurred anyway. But a statistical analysis published in 2014 in the Journal of American Medicine provides compelling evidence that the drugs are indeed to blame.    For the study, Thomas Moore and several other psychiatric researchers analyzed more than 1, 000 cases where patients reported impulse control disorders after taking any drug, and found a disproportionate number had taken dopamine agonists. On the whole, users of these drugs were 277 times more likely to report impulse control disorders than users of other medications. The   upshot of this, the researchers say, is that these drugs  —   still on the market  —   need to be labeled more carefully, and patients need to be better monitored for adverse effects. But in the long term, this sort of accidental experiment could serve as a fascinating window into how addiction works  —   and eventually improve our treatment of it.    ”Lots of drugs cause adverse effects,” Moore says. ”This is an especially interesting case because it involves such a striking set of behaviors: pathological gambling, compulsive shopping, and hypersexuality.” The new evidence that these drugs cause addictive behavior           (Shutterstock) Previously, some case studies had analyzed individual patients and their symptoms after taking these drugs. They noted the abnormally high occurrence of impulse problems in patients: Some estimated that the prevalence of such symptoms might be as high as 22 percent. With this sort of thing, though, there’s always the risk of apophenia  —   the observations of patterns in random data. ”In many cases, it’s very difficult to rule out the underlying condition as a possible causal effect,” Moore says.    To address this, he and colleagues pulled nine years of data from the FDA’s Adverse Event Reporting System, which holds reports from doctors and consumers in all countries on negative side effects from drugs. The database included 1, 580 reports of impulse control problems resulting from prescribed drugs, split into the following categories:           (Moore et al. 2014) As it turned out, 710 of these reports  —   about 45 percent  —   were linked to one of six dopamine agonist drugs. And a user of one of these drugs was 277 times more likely to report impulse control problems than the average user in the database. This tells us it’s extremely unlikely the link between these drugs and impulse control problems is imaginary. However, we still can’t calculate the exact incidence of this sort of side effect because this isn’t a complete database of all the drug’s users.  This sort of analysis could potentially overrepresent the problem. However, in a commentary appearing alongside the paper, drug safety researcher Joshua Gagne (who didn’t work on this study) notes that it could also underrepresent the problem, as it’s estimated that only around 10 percent of all adverse events are reported to the FDA database.  What’s more, the researchers found an especially strong association for two of the six drugs, in particular. Users of pramipexole and ropinirole (the generic name for Requip) were 456 and 152 times more likely, respectively, to experience an impulse control problem. And these two drugs share a similar mechanism, further reducing the chance that this is all random error. How these drugs could affect impulse control In a healthy brain, dopamine acts as a crucial neurotransmitter: It gets released by one brain cell and fits into receptors on a neighboring cell, causing it to fire and an electrical impulse to get passed along. Though dopamine is used everywhere in the brain, it’s especially important in a few different brain networks, including those involved in motor control and   behavior, like sex and drug use.              Dopamine molecules are released from the end of one brain cell (top) and stimulate receptors on another (bottom) causing an impulse to be passed along. (National Institute on Drug Abuse) In the brains of people with Parkinson’s, though, the cells responsible for making dopamine slowly die off. Among the effects of this is disrupted motor control, which causes tremors. Dopamine agonists fix this by mimicking dopamine, helping to reduce the symptoms. The two types of dopamine agonists most strongly tied with impulse control disorders, however, both act on one particular kind of dopamine receptor (the D3 receptor) which is disproportionately present on neurons involved in certain circuits involved in the brain’s reward system. Scientists speculate that in doing so, the drugs stoke this system, increasing the amount of pleasure someone feels when they experience things like food, sex, addictive drugs, or winning while gambling. ”[They] could, in effect, ’release the brake’ on brain mechanisms that would normally inhibit risky behaviors while simultaneously invigorating   behaviors,” writes Howard Weiss, a Parkinson’s researcher, in another commentary accompanying the study. What this means for patients For doctors and people who might be prescribed one of these drugs to treat tremors, the lesson of this research is pretty straightforward: Use caution. ”The FDA should place more prominent, clear warnings on these drugs, and individuals who take these drugs need to be monitored by physicians and caregivers,” Moore says. Currently, on official lists of side effects for these drugs, compulsive behavior is not listed.     And unlike, say, dizziness or nausea, people don’t normally think of excessive gambling as a side effect of a drug, so they’re much less likely to report it to doctors or blame it on a new medication. They might even try to hide this sort of thing, thinking it’s entirely their fault. These drugs don’t cause these strange symptoms in everyone, but they seem to in many, so people taking them should be on the alert. What all this tells us about the nature of addiction           (Shutterstock) On a broader level, this case represents a fascinating (though unfortunate) experiment with the human brain and could potentially tell us a lot about a mysterious topic: addiction. One of the things that makes this case so interesting is that while other drugs have been found to cause general problems with impulse control  —   the   drug Chantix, for instance, causes increased aggression, along with depression and psychosis, in some people  —   these drugs are different. They cause one very distinctive set of behaviors: addiction problems, like excessive gambling, eating, sex, and shopping. This case represents a fascinating (though unfortunate) experiment That means we can link these behaviors to one particular network in the brain and one receptor in it. ”For years, people have talked about mental disorders being biochemical imbalances, but truthfully, no one has been able to identify any specific imbalances they can measure,” Moore says. ”Here’s a study where you can actually induce, in a large number of patients, a very specific series of related behaviors based on one imbalance.” Researchers have begun using this knowledge to try to create   drugs, which would interact with the same D3 receptors but do the opposite  —   effectively reducing the amount of pleasure things like addictive drugs and gambling create.

When The Economy Goes Down, Vasectomies Go Up	2014-10-21	2014	10	The number of men getting vasectomies spiked during the Great Recession, rising   from 2006 to 2010, a study finds. In 2006, 3. 9 percent of men said they had had a vasectomy in 2010, 4. 4 percent reported having the surgery. That means an additional 150, 000 to 180, 000 men per year had vasectomies in each year of the recession. That squares with earlier research that showed birth rates dropped during the recession, falling 4 percent between 2007 and 2009. After the recession, man were making less money, were less likely to be working full time, and were less likely to have health insurance, according to the National Survey for Family Growth, which researchers at Weill Cornell Medical College used to come up with the vasectomy numbers. They reported their results Monday at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine conference in Hawaii. OK, so what were women up to? The Weill Cornell researchers didn’t look at this, but the survey did ask   women about birth control, and there was no increase in the number of women who got birth control or had sterilization surgery from 2002. Men typically aren’t nearly as apt to embrace sterilization as a form of birth control as are women. For women who use contraception, 26. 6 percent chose tubal sterilization, which is permanent, compared to 27. 5 percent for the pill, according to 2010 numbers from the Guttmacher Institute. But just 10 percent of women said they’re relying on their partner’s vasectomy to avoid pregnancy, according to Guttmacher. We’ll have to stay tuned to see if guys’ seeming embrace of vasectomy was just a recessionary blip, or if they really are saying no (or no mas) to fatherhood.
Among The Young And Privileged In North Korea	2014-10-22	2014	10	In the summer of 2011, American journalist Suki Kim got a job teaching English at the elite,   Pyongyang University of Science and Technology in the North Korean capital. Kim, who was born in South Korea and immigrated with her family to the U. S. at age 13, is a fluent Korean speaker and secretly took notes during her six months at the university in Pyongyang. This formed the basis for her new book, Without You, There Is No Us. Though the university is geared for the privileged few, the students, like all North Koreans, are tightly controlled. The young men were closely monitored by female guards, they were not allowed off campus except for group outings, and they were discouraged from asking about the wider world. On the day before Kim left the country in December 2011, North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong Il, died, sending the nation into mourning. The next morning, the students ”looked as though they’d been crying all night, as though their souls had been sucked out of them, as though they’d just lost a parent,” said Kim. She spoke with Morning Edition’s Steve Inskeep about her rare insider’s glimpse of the reclusive country. On speaking about the country’s leader  You don’t talk about Great Leader [Kim Il Sung, the country’s founder] by name. You certainly never, ever bring up anything about the outside world. The fact that I travel outside, really, is not something that I was supposed to talk about. But then, you live together for months and months and share three meals a day together. Then, suddenly, things start happening where you ask things. On what the students asked  One time, a student did ask me about a national assembly. I think it was a word he picked up somewhere. There was no way you could discuss that without bringing democracy into a conversation. And once I began talking about it, I got very nervous because the students were all watching each other and reporting on each other. After we discussed democracy at the table, later, another student, who’s a roommate of that student, told me that he’s with me. Meaning, he thinks like me. And that really scared me because I thought, then, some of them are questioning the system. On how   the students were from the wider world, Some were more sheltered than others. Whatever the reason was, on [the] surface, because it is a system so based, built on fear, they’re not supposed to admit it, even if they knew. They were never supposed to admit to knowing what’s going on outside. So, for example, we talked about the way they celebrate birthdays. Usually, they go back to their dormitory after dinner and they start singing songs, one by one. And they all always claimed the Great Leader’s songs, or songs about friendship. One time, one student said, ”Rock ’n’ roll.” The minute he said that, the whole table went quiet. The student just looked out instantly, as if some horrible thing was just admitted. And then someone changed the topic, and I realized: This is the fear. It was a kind of reality that is so impossible to imagine for us Americans, and I thought it was important to humanize North Koreans. On how the elite fear they could be purged, I’ve covered North Korea for over a decade, interviewed so many defectors, and this was the other extreme of the society, and they had no freedom. I don’t know how they absolutely keep that control. But we just saw, you know, [current leader] Kim Jung Un getting his uncle executed, Jang Song Thaek, at the end of 2013. And that is [the] No. 2 man in North Korea for decades, who is a relative of the Great Leader. I think it’s just a different system. I had assumed, also, that maybe the elite  —   you know, maybe the images that those people control  —   that they have so much freedom, but that just simply was not true. On the ubiquitous female guards at the university, It is so controlled. The guards were only women  —   young women in their early 20s  —   and they never mixed words with the staff. I tried, but they wouldn’t talk back to me. And they were minders, minders living in the faculty dormitory on the ground floor, and all they ever did was just guard us. It was very, very systematically controlled. . .. I did ask about that several times to the foreign teachers, ”Why is this the case?” The answer that I got was that in the beginning of the school, they had put men there  —   soldiers  —   but they realized that maybe it just looks too threatening, so they changed the soldiers to women soldiers. On whether the students and the guards ever fell in love, That would make a really good Hollywood movie. And I did imagine that because these were just, you know,      beautiful boys. But then I realized also, at some point, I learned that they come from a completely different social strata that it just wasn’t possible, supposedly. On what she took away from her six months at the university, This was my fifth visit in North Korea, and I felt the incredible sorrow in my last time more so than ever because I spent so much time, and I got to observe so many things firsthand at the school. And because they were so young  —   19 and 20  —   and I think from that, really loving them, to a degree, and understanding their world, it made me really think what a claustrophobic and inhuman place North Korea is. You know, it’s kind of like thinking my kids are trapped there. It was heartbreaking on a daily basis. And also to leave, and also knowing that’s the world that they will possibly be the leaders  —   they’re the future leaders of North Korea.

A Doctor’s Diary: Encountering Chaos And Kindness In An Ebola Ward	2014-10-26	2014	10	I am an infectious disease (ID) physician at Boston Medical Center, and I serve as the Director of Infection Control at National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratory, helping design medical response programs to potential exposures to viruses that cause viral hemorrhagic fevers. This summer I spent 12 days in Sierra Leone, serving as part of a team treating patients at Kenema Government Hospital’s Ebola treatment center. The center was supported by the World Health Organization with guidance, logistics and clinicians. My colleagues and I were recruited through the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, a network that WHO hosts. I traveled with Dr. George Risi, a fellow ID doc, and Kate Hurley, RN, MSN, from St. Patrick’s Hospital in Missoula, which provides medical backup to Rocky Mountain Laboratories.  My journey to Sierra Leone and Kenema Hospital to serve as a physician in the Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU) started more than a month before I actually traveled there. It is as much a mental journey as a physical one. What was once a textbook understanding of the virus quickly became an intimate experience of losing many around me to the disease. Before I left, traveling to West Africa to take care of these patients was an abstract humanitarian imperative for me. Now that I’m back, having seen what I have seen, I could never forgive myself if I did not make another trip. The first day in Sierra Leone, the day of arrival, all of the flight attendants put on gloves shortly before we landed. As I walked out into the customs halls in Lungi Airport in Freetown, every wall was plastered with posters providing information about Ebola. We were asked to complete a health questionnaire and fever check  —   one of dozens I would receive during my time in the country. In the dark rainy night, the water taxi that carried us from Lungi airport to Freetown seemed otherworldly. Seeing my   who had arrived a few hours before me, at the hotel was a big step in helping me reorient to the purpose of my journey. George, Kate and I needed to make it to Kenema in time to overlap with the outgoing team. It’s a three and a half hour trip from Freetown. On the way, we saw many children on the streets. It was a weekday. We wondered why they were not in school. Our driver told us school had been canceled because of Ebola. In fact, there were no weddings, no baptisms. People had stopped gathering. In between small villages, the lush green landscape was dotted with occasional burned buildings, remnants of the civil war. We arrived in Kenema and met the outgoing group at dinner. Their camaraderie was palpable. I could see how these relationships were critical. In this environment, you depend on the people you work with for your safety. It was hard not to feel like the new kid. We were somber at hearing about the continued dearth of healthcare workers and the patient load. On the first day at the treatment unit, we followed a clinician who’d been there for a while, learning about the available resources and the patients currently receiving treatment. Every thing I did that first day took a moment of reflection. OK, I am entering an ETU for the first time I am now seeing and caring for an Ebola patient for the first time. I am carefully coming out of my personal protective equipment (PPE) for the first time in the field  —   a time I am statistically most likely to infect myself. But after every first time, anxiety turned into resolve, and practice made the process routine. The following days were a blur. Hard work, the smell of chlorine, the heat. Each day started with a group breakfast, then the   drive to the hospital, a rush to get all the information, including overnight deaths, transfers, lab results. Although being inside the PPE was physically unbearable because of the heat, I felt a sense of urgency every morning to get into the unit. At the hospital, we each collected our PPE. We counted out the six items every day, a trick to develop muscle memory: gloves, tyvek suit, hood, face shield, mask, rubber boots. It was our shield as we walked into battle. Or so it felt. In pairs or as a team, we entered the   area. Sullivan, the man at the entrance, always had a ready smile as he sprayed down our rubber boots with bleach solution. We entered the donning tent. I saw so many people in that tent and early on wondered who they were. They were porters, hygienists, food servers. In the donning tent, we put on the equipment, checked each other out to check the suit for gaps and tears. I soon came to realize that you can spend an entire day with someone in PPE and not know what they look like. It’s why we put our names on our aprons, the top layer of the PPE, so we’d know each other’s identity. And then we entered the   zone. First it was the suspect wards, for patients who fit the case definition of Ebola and were waiting for a test to confirm the diagnosis. We called it the ”Annex.” which housed both those who will test positive and those who had symptoms similar to Ebola but may turn out to have another disease, like malaria. It was our daily challenge to separate the sick from those who are less symptomatic. The minute we entered the   zone, people were waiting on the landing of the ward entrance to ask what their test results were. Beyond the Annex were the confirmed ward and recovery wards. In the confirmed ward, the healing and the dying mingled. The hallways were filled with people at varying stages of their disease, from those on the road to recovery to those in the throes of their illness, coming to terms with the gravity of their situation. Many of these patients had already seen family members going through this and in some cases die. They were dehydrated, confused, looking at you, looking past you, too weak, bed bound, barely able to use the waste bucket next to their bed. Every day, it felt like you were putting out fires, trying to address the most urgent needs before your own resolve started to fade, your face shield fogged up, your mask was so filled with sweat you couldn’t breathe. In the ward, the patients whose tests shows they have recovered from Ebola have to be discharged so that we can make room for the new patients who have positive tests. Suspect patients who don’t have the disease have to be quickly discharged so they do not contract the infection while in the ETU. By the time you got out in the afternoon, wondering where the past few hours had gone, you were spent. On a typical day, I’d do either three   shifts in the suit, or two   shifts. The other six hours of the day I’d deal with case management and collect data to help with clinical care and keep tabs on this epidemic. And recover from the stress of being in the Ebola ward. After getting out of the PPE, I would hydrate like a marathoner. The idea that I’d put my body through that again, let alone later that afternoon, seemed unreal. But then my mind started to equilibriate with the return of the fluid and the electrolytes and I’d became strong enough to ignore the complaints of my body. Midday, we’d regroup and have lunch and share information about this patient or that. Some days I felt good coming out after a morning in the ward, as if I had made a difference and put things in order. Then three hours later I’d go back in and faced chaos. It’s as if fate was laughing at me. New patients had arrived who had not been tested some were deathly ill. Patients who looked good only a few hours ago had taken a turn for the worst. Some even died in the interim. The whole process started again: helping one human at a time and providing for immediate needs, while trying to keep my mind focused through the constant, ”Doctor, doctor” requests coming from all directions. One of the largest ethical dilemmas working in this environment was striking a balance between personal safety and patient survival. At times I’d have to leave the ward because the electricity was out and it was unsafe to continue working. It didn’t matter that I had a child in my hands who needed my help. Logically, healthcare worker safety is paramount because loss of workers will further stymie the response to the epidemic. But in reality, in that moment, as the provider for that patient, it will be the hardest choice you will make. At night, after our   days, we tried to spend some time with each other, decompressing. We tried to keep the mood light, joked, shared stories from home. We wondered if any of us could truly explain to others back home what this experience is really like. I tried to talk to family but exhaustion, and fear of revealing my own anxieties about contracting the disease, made me keep the conversations short. And then I’d do something silly, something that went against all logical understanding of this disease. I cleaned all major surfaces in my room with bleach wipes as if I was creating an invisible fortress of cleanliness, leaving the day behind me, and got into bed to fall asleep. If there are things that I wish I could share with others about my experience, they would be: 1) Most people can survive this disease. In the patients who presented to us in time, and who stayed hydrated before and during treatment, the mortality was under 40 percent. This is despite the lack of human resources and medical and lab supplies. My favorite days were days when we discharged patients from the recovery ward. One of my   asked the children in recovery to come up with a ”recovery song,” a celebration in anticipation of when their tests will turn negative and they will leave this place for home. The children would greet him every time he returned with the song. After a couple of days it was clear the adults also were partaking in this ritual. It was the most powerful thing I have ever witnessed, sometimes sitting outside the unit, hearing songs from the recovery ward. We can improve the mortality rate by just improving the number of hands helping and by giving patients the best basic supportive care. The early and continued provision of oral rehydration solution can help as well. 2) Every day I was there someone thanked me, thanked me for taking care of these patients. This encouragement was so important. I have provided care to patients in setting with limited resources, but generally as providers, we don’t have to worry about our own safety. We place an artificial barrier between ourselves and the patients, as if we are somehow immune to the diseases around us. It is an important part of being able to provide care. That façade is harder in this setting, knowing how many healthcare workers have died before us and seeing so many young people present with minimal symptoms and full faculties, and then watching them become so debilitated that they cannot get out of bed to defecate. Then to see that a hundred times over breaks the most stoic of dispositions. The words of encouragement were so important in light of the loss inside the unit. 3) Inside this ward is a microcosm of humanity and almost all of it is kindness and selflessness. A sick patient one bed over might offer to translate your words if the person you are interviewing doesn’t speak English. Healthier patients advocate for those who have taken a turn for the worst. Women adopted orphans and cared for them if the children’s own mother had died. People gave each other encouragement from across large ward rooms. Inside the wards, you found some of the most committed nurses from the local staff. Despite losing so many of their own, having their morale decimated, nurses like French, who became the head nurse at Kenema ETU, spent hours upon hours, day after day providing compassionate care. On one of my last days at Kenema, I found an old man in a triage tent who was extremely ill. I was giving him oral rehydration and kept asking him his name: ”Sir, tell me your name so I can see if you have been tested already.” He kept mumbling and when I could finally hear what he was saying repeatedly, it was, ”I am nobody. I am nobody.” I will never forget that moment. This epidemic is not one of nameless, faceless individuals living far away. It is a story of family members who expressed love and grief at losing their loved ones. It’s about strangers who provide kindness at the right time to others. It’s about children who wandered alone through the halls of illness but then made it out and survived. It’s about those who died in my hands despite all my efforts. It’s about the healthcare workers who buried their own and are continuing to work. It’s about entire communities that have been debilitated by this epidemic and about countries that will see an entire generation affected by it. It’s about putting your fear aside and doing what you know is needed in that moment. It’s about you and me and what we do next to eradicate the epidemic.

The Creepiest Ghost And Monster Stories From Around The World	2014-10-31	2014	10	It’s Halloween  —   a time for Frankenstein monsters and vampires and werewolves. But many of us have our own monsters from different cultures, and when we threw out a call to our readers asking what ghost stories and folktales they grew up with in their own traditions, we got back stories of creatures stalking the shadows of Latin American hallways and vengeful demons from South Asia with backwards feet. (And that’s before we get to the   and the infernal bathroom stalls.) Below are some of the best we’ve found or that were told to us from Code Switch readers. Read on. ..if you dare. An evil creature stalks the Tanzanian island of Pemba in the Indian Ocean. It can change shape  —   a bat sometimes, a   form at others. It prefers to come out at night, but some say they have seen it during the day. The popobawa  —   ” ” in Swahili  —   is indiscriminate in its targets. But in a common retelling, the spirit sexually assaults men. The popobawa story is rather new  —   only dating back a few decades from a time of civil unrest following the assassination of the country’s president. The popular thinking goes that after a popbawa attack, victims must spread the word to others on Pemba. Otherwise, they will continue to be visited by the popobawa. Reports of attack send some locals into a panic. A few years ago, a series of   sexual assaults were blamed on the popobawa. ”Some men are staying awake or sleeping in groups outside their homes,” the BBC reported in 2007. ”Others are smearing themselves with pig’s oil, believing this repels attacks.” A peasant farmer named Mjaka Hamad claims he was attacked by the popobawa in 1997. I couldn’t see it. I could only feel it. But some people in my house could see it. Those who’ve got the spirits in their heads could see it. Everybody was terrified. They were outside screaming Huyo! It means the Popobawa is there. I had this bad pain in my ribs where it crushed me. I don’t believe in spirits so maybe that’s why it attacked me. Maybe it will attack anybody who doesn’t believe. In Japan, the schools contain an infernal secret. If you go into the girl’s bathroom on the third floor of the building, and walk to the third stall, you might find her. ”You have to knock 3 times and call her name,” a Code Switch reader named Jessica tweeted at us. ”When you open the stall door, a little girl in a red skirt will be there.” The little girl with the bob haircut is  . She wants friends to play with, maybe. Or perhaps she wants to drag you to Hell  —   through the toilet. ”Depending on which part of Japan you live in, she may have a bloody hand and grab you, or be a lizard that devours you,” Jessica said. ”Although I am getting scared just thinking about her right now.”   has become a fixture of Japanese urban folklore over the last 70 years. The most popular origin story for the tale holds that during World War II, a schoolgirl was using the bathroom when a bomb fell on top of the building. The school collapsed on top of   who has been trapped there ever since. But Hanako isn’t the only schoolgirl who haunts Japan’s school bathrooms. Kashima Reiko, another young girl, was said to have been cut in half by a train. Now her disfigured spirit inhabits bathrooms, asking children who enter the stalls where her legs are. The legend goes that if Kashima Reiko is not satisfied with their answer, she will rip their legs off. In Brazil, a tall, skinny woman with long yellow fingernails and red eyes creeps along the rooftops, and watches families inside of their homes. She watches them as they sit at the table for dinner. She watches them while they eat. La pisadeira.  After the meal, when someone goes to sleep on a full stomach, la pisadeira sneaks into their bedroom. Then she sits on their chest so that they cannot move. The pisadeira that has attacked them watches them as they begin to panic  —   the victim’s eyes partly open, but they’re neither fully asleep or fully awake  —   helpless and trapped in a body that won’t move. Sleep paralysis is a   disorder. ”The worst thing is when you try to fight or call for help,” a Redditor said in a conversation about what the experiences with it were like. ”Your voice doesn’t work and your body will not respond. You just feel helpless.” And among those who suffer from it across many cultures, there is one, unsettling common experience  —   a sense that a malevolent force is hovering over them in their immobile state. ”The earliest one I can remember is with my mother in the room and she’s sitting on my bed, her face morphs into a demon like thing,” a Redditor shared in a thread on sleep paralysis. Or: ”A large dark figure, kind of a human silhouette, emerging from the foot of my bed and staring down at me.” (Could her ”mom” or the silhouette have be a pisadeira?) They went on. ”Ugh, I need to stop trying to remember these things. I’m getting chills.” Her name was Maria. She lived in Mexico. She had long, dark hair and a covetous heart. The man she loved would not have her, so she took her children in a fit of rage, took them down to the river, and drowned them, one by one. When the man she loved spurned her again, she realized what she’d done. She took herself to the water and threw herself in, to subject herself to the same fate as her children. But heaven would not have Maria, and she was condemned to wander the world in perpetual grief. She is La Llorona  —   the wailing woman. The people who have seen her said they can her walking, soaking wet, wearing all white. And she can be heard crying out for the little ones she killed. ”Ay, mis hijos!” she weeps. (”Oh, my children! ”) Some say that she snatches other young children as she walks, mistaking them for her own young children she knew. Children along the Mexican border grow up with her story, which traces itself to stories about several different female spirits of the Aztec empire. ”My earliest memory [of her] is being in elementary school and being in the girl’s bathroom,” says Terry Martinez, who grew up in Texas in the Rio Grande Valley. She and the other young children would try to summon La Llorona in a bathroom mirror. ”The lights had to be out,” Martinez says. ”The door had to be closed.” They’d splash water on the mirror and say her name three times. La Llorona. La Llorona. La Llorona. ”It was just seeing who could stand being in the darkroom and seeing how long we could stand there waiting for her to come out of the sink,” Martinez said. ”It usually ended with a bunch of little girls screaming and running out of the bathroom.” Kat Chow contributed to this story. 
700-year-old doodles by medieval scribes	2014-11-03	2014	11	 (CNN) My personal favorite is this. At the top of a page of angular medieval text    full of theological extrapolations and religious devotion    is a cartoon of a deadpan dog. ”It’s amazing to think that people doodled in medieval times in a similar way to how they doodle today,” said Erik Kwakkel, a book historian at Leiden University, Holland.  ”When you see the monks expressing their personalities, their sense of humor, it makes you feel like you’re traveling back through time. It’s like you’re going through the keyhole and sitting right next to them.” Indeed, that dog would not be out of place in ”The Simpsons.” The spacesuit inspired by medieval armor, ’Medieval eye candy’ Kwakkel is making an unlikely name for himself on the internet by posting ”medieval eye candy” that he comes across during the course of his research. And the doodles are by far the most popular. ”Normally, scribes would doodle or write snatches of lettering after cutting their nibs, to make sure they were the correct width,” he said. ”These   ranged from the sort of scribbled lines that people still do today to words, names, full sentences or simple drawings. Sometimes we even find pretty good drawings.” These include funny faces with long beards, big hats or noses, as well as animals, unidentifiable creatures and even caricatures of teachers and colleagues.  In the majority of cases, the doodles were never intended to be seen. They were drawn on the outside of the first and last pages of a book, which were later glued to wooden covers. But although the glue has obliterated a great many doodles and   a variety has survived the test of time. ”They offer a rare glimpse into the informal or private world of medieval monks,” Kwakkel said.  ”Personally, I love the thumbprint, which was left by a careless scribe who spilled ink on his work. It seems so fresh and human, yet it happened 700 years ago.” World’s coolest bookstores, Hidden meanings, For modern scholars, doodles and   can be more than mere curiosities.  When the scribes were trying out their quills, they often wrote in their own handwriting, rather than the heavily prescriptive styles demanded by their work. This allows academics like Kwakkel to identify individual scribes    who were rarely credited for their work    and track their careers, including when they migrated across Europe. Sometimes, they can also tell us about the classroom environment. ”I found one that is obviously a drawing of the face of a schoolmaster. You can recognize him from the teacher’s hat on his head,” Kwakkel said. ”It was obviously drawn by a student in class, seven centuries ago.” Some may have had a deeper meaning at the time too, particularly the ones in the margins of the text (known technically as ”marginalia”).  One common trope was a drawing of a person’s profile with a long, pointed nose. Kwakkel believes that this was intended to highlight a particularly important sentence, as indicated by the end of the nose. Another example shows a snatch of musical notes together with the lyrics of a hymn. The monk was probably trying to remind himself of a song this, Kwakkel says, is ”one of the earliest example of musical notation that we have.” Ancient book bound with human skin, Treasure troves of secret manuscripts, But the aspect of his work that most excites Kwakkel is the uncovering of fragments of ancient texts, which he describes as ”treasure troves” or ”stowaways.” ”After Gutenburg invented the printing press in 1436, the old handwritten manuscripts fell out of fashion. Some were thrown away, but others were chopped up and used in bindings and covers,” he explained. ”I often take 15 students to a library for three days, and we carefully open up the bindings of medieval books to reveal what is inside. ”We have found many fascinating, rare manuscripts this way. It is magical, like uncovering a time capsule.  ”I know there is a lot of stuff hidden out there in bindings waiting to be discovered, but I can’t fathom what it might be.” His discoveries include the rough workings of medieval scholars who were translating texts from Arabic to Latin. Ordinarily, only the finished copies survive, so these manuscripts open up a new area of research into the translators’ methodology. But his favorite is a stash of 132 notes, letters and receipts that came from the house of a German nobleman. One, dated 31 May 1486, was a note to a servant. ”Could you please get me some wild roses, but make sure to include some that are still in bud,” it says. ”That was breathtaking,” said Kwakkel. ”It was so casual and romantic. It as if it had been written just yesterday.” The future Underground: London’s new   tube trains, Did artists eerily predict the Ukraine crisis? Would you eat Fukushima soup?

After Ray Rice: Inside a batterer’s mind	2014-11-08	2014	11	 (CNN) He’s nothing like I imagined. His demeanor is gentle, his smile and handshake warm, his words friendly and measured. He asks permission before taking a bite of his takeout salad.  Where’s the batterer I’ve come to meet? The man who grabbed, pushed and punched a woman he claimed to love?  The one I’ve enlisted to help me understand: Why do some men do this? How can they be stopped?  ”Dylan” is Ivy   a   nerd who was raised by loving parents with advanced degrees. He grew up in a beautiful home in a tony Atlanta suburb. He enjoyed every privilege a boy could want. He vacationed in places like Cairo, London and Paris before he could even shave. He defies the stereotypical image of a batterer I have in mind. I’m ashamed of my own naiveté. Lesson one: Just because he had it so good doesn’t mean he wasn’t capable of becoming brutal.  Dylan has met me after work in a quiet office outside Atlanta. He’s asked that I change his name and hide his identity to protect him and his victim. In exchange, he has agreed to take me back to a time he’d rather forget. He will map out how he became an abuser. And how, some 10 years later, he became a new person, the man he wanted to be. Going inside the mind of a batterer, I’ll learn, means examining much more than the images we hold onto. The story of suspended NFL running back Ray Rice, and other abusers, doesn’t end with a   punch in an elevator or an attack never seen on video. Nor do these tragedies begin there.  Power and control, Dylan’s parents weren’t perfect. Neither were friends who he idolized. Not many people are.  Scene one: His mother and father argued. The abuse was verbal, sometimes physical. Twice he watched his father push his mother.   Scene two: He was sitting on a bus in the high school parking lot. He watched out the window as an upperclassman he respected struck his girlfriend. Hard. She was the sort of girl Dylan dreamed of dating someday. He gawked with others as she cowered and bled. At home and at school, no one talked about what Dylan saw. Love between a man and a woman, as far as he could tell, was allowed to look this way.  Now, in his   Dylan has a tool for identifying what he witnessed    and how he acted himself.  ”Have you ever seen the power and control wheel?” he asks me.  I have no idea what this means. He pulls out a sheet with a round diagram. It shows tactics a man might use to gain leverage in a relationship, ways he may behave before resorting to physical or sexual violence. These are the less obvious, but insidious, means by which men keep women down. Red flags Dylan couldn’t identify back then. Minimizing. Coercion. Male privilege. At first, the language sounds like   psychobabble. But soon I realize that the wheel represents everything I’d like to caution my nieces about before they go out into the world.  Dylan was in college when he met his first girlfriend. Early on, without even knowing her friends, he told her he didn’t like them. Isolation. Controlling who she sees.  When she came to his room later at night than he wanted, he locked the door    something he never did otherwise    and made her knock. He took his time answering to remind her who was boss. Male privilege. Acting like the ”master of the castle.”   Fast forward to after college. He was living with a new girlfriend, ”Isabelle,” in Atlanta. She might have had the better job, but he was the one who could drive. She has a disability and depended on him to get to work. He didn’t let her forget it. Threats. Making her feel guilty. The cloud of economic abuse she could lose her job.  His boss treated him like an idiot, but Dylan felt he had to take it. Out in the world, it seemed like people walked all over him. So at home, Dylan exerted power in the only place he felt he could. He was making more money by then, he says, and had earned the right to ”act like a man.” More male privilege. Defining their roles. He criticized how she did her hair, what she wore, even the way she filled the dishwasher. Emotional abuse. Making her feel small and humiliated.  You see how this works, right? He kept the wheel   and it would eventually spin out of control. Smarter than this, It’s one thing to hear his story, but what about hers? Once I learned he was still in touch with Isabelle, I told Dylan I wanted to give voice to her perspective, too. It seemed only fair, I said. He didn’t think she’d be interested in talking, but he agreed to reach out to her for me. A week later, Isabelle and I first communicated.  She was eager to speak, but only if I used a pseudonym. She doesn’t want her past to define her present or future. Growing up thousands of miles from Dylan, Isabelle watched her father suppress her mother. He degraded her with his words and threw things to intimidate her. Even though her mother would later find the strength to leave, Isabelle learned early about submission. Today, she seems   and certainly no pushover as we share chips and salsa in a small Mexican joint. Thinking back to how her relationship with Dylan unfolded, she says she should have seen what was coming.  Survivors of domestic abuse speak out, She’d taken to going away on weekends to escape him. She pleaded with him to move out of her house, but he wouldn’t budge. He used her inability to drive against her    even though she’d managed just fine before he came along.  He isolated her from friends and family. Too ashamed to admit how unhappy and worried she was, she isolated herself further. He put her down in public and made her feel like a child. She was embarrassed. After all, she had a master’s degree. She was smarter than this.  Still, for so long, she hungered for what they had when the relationship was good. ”I wanted him to come back to me as I remembered him,” she says. ”I lived for those moments when he would show up.” When she changed the radio station in the car without asking, he says he gave her a push and yelled about wanting to be respected.  She remembers him pinning her against the door in the moving car and worried that if it opened she’d be a goner.  When she once called him an asshole, he grabbed her arm: ”If you want to call me an asshole, I’ll show you an asshole,” he says. Why I stayed: Tangles of domestic abuse, It was a Sunday morning, when he crossed the line for the last time. This is how Dylan recalls it: She’d been up late talking on the phone with a male friend, and Dylan decided she was cheating. He ripped up some of her favorite photographs. He called her a bitch and a whore. He took a vase of flowers    ”they were irises,” he says, thinking back a decade    and dumped it over her head. He threatened to break her cell phone. And then, he unleashed his remaining rage with a punch to her chest. ”In that moment,” he says, ”I realized what I’d done.” He picked up the flowers and poured on the apologies. He left to give her space. He was at his parents’ house when the sheriff’s deputy drove up and served him a temporary restraining order.  Dylan never fought it. That last punch was a jolt to him, too. He’d assaulted his girlfriend of more than four years on, of all days, Father’s Day.  ”I will not bring a child into this,” he remembers thinking. ”I was very clear that I needed to find a new way to move in the world because the way I was moving wasn’t working and wasn’t healthy.”  When he stood before the court, he quickly agreed to stay away from her for a year. He didn’t want her to have to sit on a stand and recount all he’d done.  He says he wanted to protect her feelings. But to be honest, Dylan didn’t want to hear it.  ’Lucky to be alive’ The story she tells is less sanitized and more haunting. Isabelle says on the day of ”the incident,” she thought she’d die. She hadn’t been on the phone late at night, as he remembers it. No, she’d escaped to a hotel to crash with visiting friends and had stayed up late with them.  Back home that Sunday morning, Isabelle was jolted awake from a nap when he grabbed her. ”He called me a whore,” she says, and began ”ragdolling me around the house.”  That vase of flowers he spilled over her? He intended to break it over her head, she believes, but she was able to push his arm away. He tried to snap her cell phone in two and asked her which half she’d want. She tried to close a door between them, which only enraged him further: ”Never shut the door on me!” Then came that punch to her chest, which sent her      frame flying into a heap of laundry on the floor. The world, she says, fell silent. And then ”the universe said just play dead, and so I did.” He was sufficiently freaked out and backed off long enough for her to crawl into the bathroom and lock herself inside.  He peppered her with apologies through the door. He offered her Advil. She laughs at the absurdity of that suggestion. As if Advil could make things better?  ”You need to leave,” she says she told him. ”And I suggest you take an overnight bag.” She’s grateful there was no weapon in the house. A friend came over to help her. She called a locksmith to change the locks before she left the house. She wore a turtleneck to hide the growing bruises. She pretended she was OK. But in the restaurant where the two friends went, Isabelle could barely breathe. Her friend took her to the hospital, where ”the doctor said, ’I don’t know how you’re alive.’ ” One inch to the left, she was told, and the direct blow to her chest could have killed her.  ”I’m very lucky,” she says. ”I have angels on my shoulders.” Owning what he’d done, Dylan promised the court he’d stay away. No contact. No phone calls. No showing up at her door. He paid restitution, covering some expenses such as the cost of changing the locks in her house.  He then set out to change himself.  He camped out in the   section of Barnes  Noble. He armed himself with books, including ”Anger Management for Dummies.”  When books could only take him so far, he sought out more and came across Men Stopping Violence, a national training institute committed to creating safer communities for women and girls. The    organization conducts trainings in churches, corporations, community groups, government agencies and schools.  The primary aim is prevention, to help society understand and change the social norms that create violent men    and thereby prevent the abuse of women from even starting. Only a small fraction of batterers get busted, explains MSV Executive Director Ulester Douglas. It’s better to engage all men before they abuse    whether they are black, white, rich, poor, young or old. ”If we rely only on intervention, we miss the mark,” Douglas says. ”Prevention is what we need, and this must be a systemic approach.”  But there is an intervention arm of MSV, and Dylan signed up for its   educational course to learn alternatives to controlling and abusive behavior.  The   course, which teaches about 220 men a year, draws those who’ve been sent under court order and men, like Dylan, who      oftentimes because they feel they have too much to lose. Maybe a wife has threatened to leave unless they get help.  Or protective services has required their attendance before they can see their children again.  Dylan learned to let go of his definition of manhood, the image society drills into boys. It says tears are for sissies, vulnerability is a sign of weakness. It teaches that the only manly emotions are anger and rage.  He owned what he’d done and who he’d become. Only then could he change. He found out how to be intentional and thoughtful. He became versed in what Men Stopping Violence calls ”The Arc of Choice,” a path lined with ”speed bumps” to stop   attacks    verbal or otherwise. He learned to take deep breaths and think about his choices. He learned to honor his true emotions and not hide behind others. He learned to listen to his body and catch himself before acting. He learned to, as he put it, ”center myself in a spirit of patience, respect, peace, love and empathy for what the other person is feeling.”   ’It has to be hopeful’ Today Dylan sees himself as a better man. He went on to work in the field of social justice, dedicating his time to the protection of women. And he volunteers with Men Stopping Violence.  He says he’s had healthy relationships and is in one now.  He calls Isabelle his best friend. That gives her pause. She cares for him deeply, sees him as a sort of brother and believes that he’s grown and changed. She doesn’t believe for a second that he would hurt another woman. But best friend? Sometimes she feels that way other times she struggles to go that far.  ”I forgave that day because I choose to forgive,” she says. ”But some of my life got stolen.” She’s proud of his success, the career he’s built, but knows    in some ways    she paid for it. He wouldn’t be doing what he’s doing, after all, if he hadn’t abused her and found his way to Men Stopping Violence.  For her, the ripple effects still linger. Call it PTSD.  If a man takes her arm unexpectedly, she flinches. A critical comment, no matter how small, can set her back to a different time. A scream, even at a television during a football game, might leave her rattled.  While he can cut out the ugly details of the past, she doesn’t feel she can. This old relationship still shapes how she relates to men, no matter all the therapy she’s had. Her radar is on for bad things to come, and sometimes she worries that she’ll miss the signs. When a man says something nice to her, she may wonder if she’s being manipulated. She doesn’t love as freely. But she also emerged on the other side empowered in new ways. She isn’t afraid to stand up for herself. She’s strong enough to know she’d rather be alone than mistreated.  Isabelle is only willing to share her part of the journey because she wants women to see their value. She wants to give hope to those in unhealthy or dangerous relationships.  ”I want our story to encourage women to get out    and men to get help,” she says. ”It has to be hopeful. Otherwise I’d rather keep this chapter in the past.”  She knows there are those who can’t understand the friendship she’s built with Dylan. Cutting ties, though, isn’t easy when there’s history.  Isabelle will be the first to admit that letting Dylan into her life was a gamble. But she chooses to see the good in him. And she knows he’s unusual. He’s taken responsibility. He’s accountable. He is so in tune with the patterns of men that she benefits from his advice. ”It’s like getting counseling without paying for it,” she says. And she’s not afraid to dole out her own feedback to keep him in line.  ”I found my voice,” she says, ”and he learned to listen.” Glimmer of understanding, The story of Dylan and Isabelle moves me. It also terrifies me. They are beyond unique that’s clear. I mean, how many men who’ve battered really go on to build a career dedicated to protecting women? How many women who’ve been abused can safely befriend their abuser?  I lose sleep wondering if it’s too good to be true.  It’s a Friday afternoon when I stroll in to the DeKalb County Courthouse for a reality check. Around me are men who’ve recently been arrested for misdemeanor charges related to domestic violence. They are only here because the court made them show up at this afternoon class as a condition for bond. No one is happy to be here. Some are outwardly mad. What about when you’ve got a woman beating on you? What if a girl likes it and puts up with it? I don’t like the idea of getting locked up for something I didn’t do. What if she wanted to get me in trouble and knew if she called the cops the system would be on her side? These questions are tossed at the facilitators of ”Tactics  Choices,” offered by Men Stopping Violence. They have a little more than three hours to engage men, shift thinking and, hopefully, protect women. If they’re lucky, some of these men will later land in their   course, the type that helped Dylan. ”I know we don’t live with angels. I know we don’t live with saints,” a teacher says. ”But the only person in the world I can control is myself.”  The conversation is steered toward the importance of building partnerships based on respect and equality. Men are reminded that if a relationship isn’t healthy for them, they should get out. This talk about equality, though, doesn’t fly with everyone. If I make more money, then I have the last word.  We are designed to fill certain roles in relationships. It’s biblical. Why is man’s role being so feminized? In a minute, we’re all going to be wearing dresses.  I want to learn how to be successful in a relationship without being sensitive. ”I want you to hear this: The world is changing,” warns an instructor. ”Begin to change your thinking, renew your mind, grow into a new possibility.” During the last hour of the course, as instructors guide the men through exercises, I see a few light bulbs go off    but I wonder, once they leave the room and return to their environments, will the glimmer of understanding fade? Can they, like Dylan, give change a chance? Or will they walk the path they’ve already traveled and abuse again? And, most pressing to me, how many Isabelles will suffer in their wakes? 
Get it straight: The difference between Memorial Day and Veterans Day	2014-11-10	2014	11	 (CNN) We are here to make sure you don’t embarrass yourself.  Inevitably, someone says something demonstrating confusion over the difference between Memorial Day and Veterans Day. Allow us to explain it to you. Memorial Day: Celebrated the last Monday in May, Memorial Day is the holiday set aside to pay tribute to those who died serving in the military.  The website for the United States Department of Veterans Affairs recounts the start of Memorial Day this way: ”Three years after the Civil War ended, on May 5, 1868, the head of an organization of Union veterans    the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR)    established Decoration Day as a time for the nation to decorate the graves of the war dead with flowers. Maj. Gen. John A. Logan declared that Decoration Day should be observed on May 30. It is believed that date was chosen because flowers would be in bloom all over the country.” The passage of the National Holiday Act of 1971 by Congress made it an official holiday. Veterans Day: This federal holiday falls on November 11 and is designated as a day to honor all who have served in the military. According to Military. com, Veterans Day began as Armistice Day to honor the end of World War I, which officially took place on November 11, 1918. ”In 1954, after having been through both World War II and the Korean War, the 83rd U. S. Congress    at the urging of the veterans service organizations    amended the Act of 1938 by striking out the word ”Armistice” and inserting the word ”Veterans,” the site says. ”With the approval of this legislation on June 1, 1954, November 11 became a day to honor American veterans of all wars.” 5 ways to honor veterans beyond Veterans Day, Just for good measure, we will also throw in some information about Labor Day because, believe it or not, we’ve seen folks thanking troops on that holiday. Labor Day, the first Monday in September, honors the contributions of American workers, not the military.
6 questions about Washington, DC, statehood you were too disenfranchised to ask	2014-11-12	2014	11	 This November, residents of Washington, DC, will vote on whether the District should become the 51st state.    The initiative is very likely to pass, given that statehood polls very well in DC. But it also very likely won’t go into effect: The results aren’t legally binding, and the referendum would require congressional approval  —   something that’s almost certainly not going to happen. Still, DC’s lack of statehood affects every single law, even the budget, passed by the DC Council and voters. It also means the roughly 650, 000 people living in DC  —   more than the population of Vermont or Wyoming  —   don’t have full congressional representation, since only states get voting representatives in the US House and Senate. This is, to be blunt, a form of disenfranchisement. So it’s little surprise that most of DC seems interested in change.    1) What would a DC state look like?           Laws passed by DC Council and approved by Mayor Muriel Bowser wouldn’t need congressional approval if DC were a state. (Michael   Washington Post via Getty Images)    Based on the current ballot initiative, statehood for Washington, DC, means carving most of the current city out of what’s considered the federal District of Columbia and turning the remaining area into a new state. The measure would create a new state, called Washington, Douglass Commonwealth (which shortens to Washington, DC) would leave the US Capitol, White House, Supreme Court, National Mall, and nearby national parks and monuments as the federal District of Columbia. The rest of the current district would be fashioned as the new state.    It would look something like this, with the red space representing the new state and the white space representing the new District of Columbia:            An image of ”New Columbia.” (New Columbia Vision)  This scheme would grant Washington, DC, residents full congressional representation and eliminate the need for a congressional review of local laws. But even if the initiative gets approval from DC voters, it likely won’t happen. The initiative effectively tasks the DC Council with petitioning Congress to approve statehood  —   and it’s extremely unlikely that Congress will approve the petition, for reasons noted below.    Still, advocates hope that a big vote in favor of statehood will at least put pressure on Congress to do something about the disenfranchisement of the hundreds of thousands of people who live in DC. 2) What’s the case for DC statehood?           Rep. Eleanor Norton ( ) acts as a delegate for Washington, DC, in Congress, but she doesn’t have full voting powers. (Marvin   Washington Post via Getty Images) Statehood would give DC residents full representation, which they currently lack, in Congress. It would also prevent Congress from interfering in local laws that don’t typically fall under congressional jurisdiction in any other US city or state. DC currently votes for delegates to Congress, but the representatives are largely symbolic figures without full voting rights in the legislative chambers. But DC residents still have to, for example, pay federal taxes, even as they have little to no voice in the legislative body that sets those tax rates. (Statehood advocates have criticized this with the motto ”taxation without representation,” which appears on DC license plates and is a twist of the   rallying call against the British Empire.) DC residents also have limited say in who will be in the president’s cabinet, head any federal agency, or serve on any federal court, because it’s ultimately up to the Senate, where DC delegates have no voting power, to approve those appointments. Statehood would also remove what many advocates characterize as Congress’s needless meddling in DC’s local affairs. Statehood advocates want DC, like any other city or state in the country, to be able to set its own laws and budgets without getting any form of congressional approval. They point to numerous examples in which Congress held up local laws for marijuana policy, gun control, and even combating  .    ”We want to be treated just like any other state,” Eleanor Norton, the district’s nonvoting delegate in the House, previously told me. ”To understand statehood, you have to understand what it means to be unequal in your own country.” 3) What’s the case against DC statehood?           A portrait of George Washington signing the Constitution. (  Images) Opponents of statehood argue the Founding Fathers always intended Washington, DC, to remain under federal control. Article I of the Constitution states, ”The Congress shall have Power   …     To exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten Miles square) as may, by Cession of particular States, and the Acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of the Government of the United States.” ”It’s a company town, and the company is government,” Roger Pilon of the libertarian Cato Institute told the Washington Post. ”That’s not a state.” James Madison, one of the founders, argued in the Federalist Papers that the federal government needs control of the nation’s capital so it can maintain policies that fit federal lawmakers’ needs. Madison was particularly concerned that a single state could impose control over Congress by managing its security needs and other accommodations. Opponents claim DC is very reliant on federal funds, so the federal government should have a larger say in the district’s local affairs. (But 21 states relied on more federal funding as a percentage of their state budgets in 2013.)    Opponents also argue that many of the issues addressed by statehood could be fixed if, alternatively, a bulk of the nation’s capital was absorbed into neighboring Maryland or Virginia. That would give Washington, DC, residents congressional representation through Maryland or Virginia, and it would stop congressional intervention into local laws. There are also politically motivated arguments against statehood. Statehood would very likely net Democrats two senators and one representative in Congress, because the District of Columbia is a Democratic stronghold. Since which party holds the majority in the Senate can often be decided by one or two senators, DC statehood is a politically risky endeavor for Republicans. (Some of this has racial connotations, since DC is dominated by Democrats largely due to its   makeup.) But there’s a simple mathematical reason for all sitting representatives and senators, even Democrats, to oppose statehood. If another state were allowed into the union, it would dilute the vote of currently serving federal lawmakers  —   and therefore make it slightly more difficult for these lawmakers to pass laws that favor the states they represent. Under the current setup, each senator makes up 1 percent of the Senate. If another state joined the US, that would tick down to slightly less than 1 percent. 4) Why does DC have a local government if it’s a federal district?           Former Washington, DC, Mayor Vincent Gray could be in office thanks to the Home Rule Act. (Alex   Images News) Washington, DC, currently has a sitting local government, composed of a council, mayor, and other local agencies. But this has only been the case for slightly more than four decades  —   since Congress passed the Home Rule Act of 1973. Prior to the Home Rule Act, Congress set DC’s laws. The Home Rule Act made it so the local government could approve its own laws, although only after 30 or 60 days of congressional review depending on the type of policy. Congress can also block DC’s laws through budgetary requirements.    ”Congress can intervene at any time in the district’s business,” Norton explained. ”The worst part of that is intervening in our budget affairs when they’re local only.” 5) What are some examples of congressional intervention in DC?           The   raids frequently used by SWAT teams  today partly originated in Washington, DC. (Tom    Images Sport)  Congress used the District to test out what would become war on drugs policies such as mandatory minimum sentences,   raids, and methadone clinics, according to historian Kathleen Frydl’s The Drug Wars in America,  . After these programs were piloted in DC in the   century, they would later be tied to federal drug prohibition laws.  For nearly 12 years, Congress stopped DC from establishing medical marijuana dispensaries.  Congress has blocked DC from legalizing marijuana sales even after voters overwhelmingly voted to legalize possession. Congress has repeatedly blocked DC from using local tax dollars to fund abortion services.  From 1998 to 2007, Congress banned a clean needle exchange program, meant to reduce the risk of spreading HIV or hepatitis with dirty needles, preventing the establishment of a program that literally saves lives.   6) Is statehood really going to happen?           The Republican takeover of the Senate further reduces the chances of DC statehood. (Win   Images News) Probably not. Statehood would need to get majority approval from both chambers of Congress, and Republicans, who are largely opposed to the concept for political reasons, currently control both. (Some critics, like Pilon of the Cato Institute, argue statehood would also require a constitutional amendment, since, among other reasons, DC is mentioned in the 23rd Amendment.) When President Barack Obama and a   Congress took office in 2009, advocates were hopeful that statehood could become reality. But the issue never garnered much support in the politically tense environments of the time, and the opportunity slipped by after Republicans took over the House of Representatives in 2011. But Aaron Davis reported for the Washington Post that on top of pursuing a vote on the ballot in November to put political pressure on Congress, Mayor Muriel Bowser also hopes to pursue the ”Tennessee model” for statehood:     Aides to Bowser said a broader push for statehood would follow a process known as the ”Tennessee model.” When Tennessee was admitted to the union as the 16th state, it was a federal territory, much like the nation’s capital. Congress agreed to allow Tennessee to become a state without ratification by the existing states. Instead, it required a vote of residents in the territory to approve a state constitution and a pledge to form a   government.  Since Republicans generally oppose the idea of DC statehood, this likely has no chance of passing the current Congress. But with an election this November, statehood advocates may see another potential opening  —   although only if Democrats, in a very unlikely scenario, keep the White House, take the House and Senate, and decide to prioritize the issue. 
Credit card thieves take gas in ’pump and dump’ scheme	2014-11-12	2014	11	Lilburn, Georgia (CNN) The man in the white shirt was pumping gas into an   white van. But he was no ordinary customer. For one, it took him a long time at the pump.  And then there were the stolen credit cards police say he took out of his wallet. In the 17 minutes he was at the pump, he used two cards to pump 95 gallons of diesel fuel. What happened at this gas station outside Atlanta is part of a crime wave around the country, police say. It’s called ”pump and dump.” Thieves use stolen credit cards to get gas and then sell it at   prices to truckers and gas stations that are part of the scheme.  Authorities say it’s a   dollar crime with a quick payoff. The criminals look as if they are pumping gas like any other customer. But their vehicles are vans, trucks and SUVs fitted with hidden tanks that can hold several hundred gallons. The hidden tanks range from sophisticated contraptions to a simple plastic or metal container inside the vehicle. ”It’s a very lucrative way to make money. It runs below the radar,” said U. S. Secret Service Agent Steve Scarince, who supervises the agency’s Los Angeles Fraud Task Force, and tracks the crime around the country.  Scarince said the gas theft rings in the Los Angeles area typically resell the stolen gas to gas stations for a fraction of the usual cost. The stations then sell it on    at full price    to the public. In other parts of the country, police have arrested thieves who resell the stolen gas to independent truckers or who use it themselves. The crime typically starts with the thieves stealing credit card information or buying stolen numbers online. They then use those cards to buy gas. But catching and prosecuting them can be a lengthy process.   Det. Bert Ross, of the Lilburn, Georgia, police department, worked an   investigation into a pump and dump group with assistance from the U. S. Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies. That investigation recently resulted in five arrests for fraud, forgery and identify theft. Ross identified the man who spent 17 minutes at the pump using two stolen credit cards as Edwin Ramos, 36, who bought $350 worth of diesel fuel.  Ramos is being sought by police. ”They’re buying fuel using stolen credit card information,” Ross said. ”Either they’re getting the cards themselves or they’re having them embossed, and using stolen credit cards to buy diesel fuel. They’re transporting that fuel around the state, sometimes outside the state.” Ross said the gas theft investigation in Lilburn began after a suspicious clerk in a gas station convenience store tipped off police to a customer pumping a large amount of gas into the same truck every day. ”She would go out, she’d write down tags, print out the receipt and put it to the side,” Ross said. ”For a while, I’d go in every couple days, I’d walk in and she would have an envelope there for me, full of transactions. I’d go back and say, ’OK I know this guy, I know him, but I don’t know this guy. Let’s figure out who this guy is to see how he fits in the network. ’” The investigation led to    Jorge Garcia Ramirez, whom Ross described as the ringleader of the group. Ramirez has not entered a plea to the fraud, forgery and identify theft charges. ”Typically, they’ll go in because credit cards restrict the maximum amount of fuel you can put in a vehicle, which is usually $75, so they’ll make anywhere between two and eight transactions at different gas stations in a day,” Ross said. ”They use one credit card and they pump three times for $75. And then they would go to another gas station and do the same thing,” he said. ”They operate six days a week. They typically take off Sundays.”

’If We Left, They Wouldn’t Have Nobody’ 	2014-11-21	2014	11	When an assisted living home in California shut down last fall, many of its residents were left behind, with nowhere to go. The staff at the Valley Springs Manor left when they stopped getting paid  —   except for cook Maurice Rowland and Miguel Alvarez, the janitor. ”There was about 16 residents left behind, and we had a conversation in the kitchen, ’What are we going to do?’ ” Rowland says. ”If we left, they wouldn’t have nobody,” the    Alvarez says. Their roles quickly transformed for the elderly residents, who needed    care. ”I would only go home for one hour, take a shower, get dressed, then be there for   days,” says Alvarez. Rowland, 35, remembers passing out medications during those long days. He says he didn’t want to leave the residents  —   some coping with dementia  —   to fend for themselves. ”I just couldn’t see myself going home  —   next thing you know, they’re in the kitchen trying to cook their own food and burn the place down,” Rowland says. ”Even though they wasn’t our family, they were kind of like our family for this short period of time.” For Alvarez, the situation brought back memories from his childhood. ”My parents, when they were younger, they left me abandoned,” he says. ”Knowing how they are going to feel, I didn’t want them to go through that.” Alvarez and Rowland spent several days caring for the elderly residents of Valley Springs Manor until the fire department and sheriff took over. The incident led to legislation in California known as the Residential Care for the Elderly Reform Act of 2014. ”If I would’ve left, I think that would have been on my conscience for a very long time,” says Rowland.

Cleveland police shooting of Tamir Rice: city to pay $6 million after 12-year-old’s death	2014-11-24	2014	11	" On November 22, 2014, Tamir Rice was throwing snowballs and playing with a toy pellet gun in a Cleveland park when a police car rolled into the snowy field. Within two seconds of getting out of his squad car, officer Timothy Loehmann shot and killed the   . The officer has claimed he thought the pellet gun was a real firearm.    On Monday, the city of Cleveland announced it had agreed to pay the Rice family $6 million in a lawsuit settlement over the shooting.  Related Why police so often see unarmed black men as threats  The settlement brings some solace to the family after a year and a half of inaction. Previously, former Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy McGinty announced there would be no criminal charges filed against the officers involved. McGinty said that while there was evidence of miscommunication between a 911 dispatcher and the police officers, there was not enough evidence to suggest that the cops had cleared the very high bar for criminal charges in police shooting cases. So he recommended no charges, and a grand jury complied.    McGinty was later ousted from his position, largely over his handling of the shooting.    The Rice shooting garnered nationwide attention, elevated by the Black Lives Matter movement that’s protested racial disparities in law enforcement’s use of force following the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. All of this is especially of concern in Cleveland, where investigations have found the police department has a troubling history of using excessive use of force.    Cleveland police officer shot Rice within seconds of arriving at the scene Loehmann shot Rice within two seconds of getting out of his patrol car, according to surveillance video obtained by Cleveland. com’s Cory Shaffer. He then stumbled back and fell, reportedly hurting his leg and ankle. Loehmann’s partner, Garmback, remained at the wheel of the car.    Warning: Graphic footage of the shooting and its aftermath:  According to documents from the Cuyahoga County Sheriff’s Department, it’s unclear whether Loehmann shouted any warnings before opening fire. Loehmann claimed that Rice grabbed the pellet gun, which he thought was an actual firearm, forcing him to shoot  —   a claim that McGinty, the former local prosecutor, said he believed. ”He gave me no choice,” Loehmann told another officer moments after the shooting. ”He reached for the gun and there was nothing I could do.”    It’s crucial, legally, that Loehmann perceived the pellet gun as a real firearm. As I’ll explain later, what matters legally is not whether Rice actually posed a threat, but whether Loehmann perceived one. So if Loehmann genuinely thought Rice was carrying a real gun and aiming it at other people, that would legally justify using deadly force, even if Rice was in reality doing no such thing and the gun was a toy. Garmback quickly reported the shooting to dispatch and requested emergency personnel respond to the scene. But the officers  —   neither of whom reportedly had first aid kits or training  —   then stood around without applying first aid for about four minutes after Rice was shot. It wasn’t until an FBI agent, who is a trained paramedic, walked into the scene that Rice received first aid. ”He reached for the gun and there was nothing I could do” The FBI agent described Loehmann and Garmback as almost    —   wanting to do something but not knowing what to do. Rice acknowledged the FBI agent, showing signs of life as the agent tried to tend to the boy’s wounds without any medical tools. ”He turned over and acknowledged and looked at me, and he, like, reached for my hand,” the agent said, later adding that Rice said his name and mumbled something about the pellet gun. The video also shows Rice’s sister running to the scene, reportedly to check on her wounded brother. The officers confronted the    girl, wrestled her to the ground, and restrained her in the police car.    Paramedics  arrived a few minutes later. They eventually took Rice to the hospital,  where he died on November 23. Police initially estimated Rice was around 20 years old The FBI agent at the scene, Loehmann, and Garmback thought Rice  —  who was     and 195 pounds  —   was an older teenager or in his 20s. ”Shots fired, male down, black male, maybe 20,” said the officer who called in the shooting, according to BuzzFeed’s Mike Hayes.   RelatedHow systemic racism entangles all police officers  —   even black cops  It’s not uncommon for police to overestimate the age and size of black boys. Various studies have found that the general public and police tend to see them as less innocent and older. For police officers, this can result in overestimating them as a threat. Perception matters a lot in the court system: What matters legally is whether an officer perceives a threat; that perception legally justifies using deadly force, not whether the victim actually posed a threat. So if Loehmann really thought that Rice was much older, that could help justify his use of deadly force, since a    is a much more plausible threat than a   . A 911 caller warned the pellet gun was ”probably fake”  BB gun Cleveland police said a 12yo boy pulled from his waistband before they shot him. http:  .  pic. twitter. 
  —   Cory Shaffer (@cory_shaffer) November 23, 2014  Rice had in his waistband a pellet gun with the orange safety  indicator removed, and officers said he clutched the gun when they arrived. Officers did not know the weapon was a toy  at the time of the shooting, according to police.    The friend who loaned Rice the gun reportedly told him to be careful with it since it looked real, according to the Cuyahoga County Sheriff’s Department’s investigation into the shooting. The friend had apparently taken the gun apart to fix it, and couldn’t reattach the orange safety indicator that indicates the gun is fake. Police arrived on the scene after receiving a 911 call. A caller told 911 dispatchers that a ”juvenile” is ”pulling a gun in and out of his pants and pointing it at people.” He later added, ”It’s probably fake.”  But the 911 dispatcher never relayed to Loehmann and Garmback that the caller thought Rice was a juvenile or that the gun was probably fake. She refused an interview with the Cuyahoga County Sheriff’s Department to explain why she didn’t provide that information to the officers. The officer who shot Rice was judged unfit for duty by a suburban police department in 2012               Loehmann began working at the Cleveland police department in March,  but he previously worked for six months at a small suburban police  department in Ohio. Loehmann resigned after a report deemed him unfit  for duty, in part because he couldn’t properly handle a firearm. The Guardian’s Tom McCarthy reported:  A police officer who shot a    dead in a Cleveland park late last month had been judged unfit for police service two years earlier by a small suburban force where he worked for six months, according to records released on Wednesday. Officer Timothy Loehmann, who killed Tamir Rice on 22 November, was   specifically faulted for breaking down emotionally while handling a live   gun. During a training episode at a firing range, Loehmann was  reported  to be ”distracted and weepy” and incommunicative. ”His handgun   performance was dismal,” deputy chief Jim Polak of the Independence, Ohio, police department wrote in an internal memo. The memo concludes with a recommendation that Loehmann be ”released   from the employment of the City of Independence”. Less than a week   later, on 3 December 2012, Loehmann resigned.  Other records reported by Cleveland. com’s Andrew Tobias showed Loehmann failed the written entrance exam for the Cuyahoga County Sheriff’s Department. He also reportedly failed to get hired at police departments in Akron, Euclid, and Parma Heights.    City officials said they weren’t aware of Loehmann’s troubled history at other police departments when they hired him. A federal investigation found Cleveland police are poorly trained and inappropriately violent              A Department of Justice investigation, which didn’t look at the Rice shooting, found Cleveland police officers used excessive deadly force, including  shootings and head strikes with impact weapons; unnecessary, excessive,  and retaliatory force, including Tasers, chemical sprays, and their  fists; and excessive force against people with mental illness or in  crisis, including one situation in which officers were called  exclusively to check up on someone’s  . Police officers also used ”poor and dangerous tactics” that often put  them ”in situations where avoidable force becomes inevitable and places  officers and civilians at unnecessary risk,” according to the report. The Justice Department attributed many of these problems to  inadequate training and supervision. ”Supervisors tolerate this behavior  and, in some cases, endorse it,” the report said. ”Officers report that  they receive little supervision, guidance, and support from the  Division, essentially leaving them to determine for themselves how to  perform their difficult and dangerous jobs.” Former US Attorney General Eric Holder, who headed the Justice Department at the time of the investigation, argued that fixing these issues is crucial for both the  general public and police. ”Accountability and legitimacy are essential  for communities to trust their police departments, and for there to be  genuine collaboration between police and the citizens they serve,” he  said. Black people are much more likely to be killed by police than their white peers            An analysis of the available FBI data by Vox’s Dara Lind shows that US police kill black people at disproportionate rates: They accounted for 31 percent of police killing victims in 2012, even though they made up just 13 percent of the US population. Although the data is incomplete, since it’s based on voluntary reports from police agencies around the country, it highlights the vast disparities in how police use force.    Black teens were 21 times as likely as white teens to be shot and killed by police between 2010 and 2012, according to a ProPublica analysis of the FBI data. ProPublica’s Ryan Gabrielson, Ryann Grochowski Jones, and Eric Sagara reported: ”One way of appreciating that stark disparity, ProPublica’s analysis shows, is to calculate how many more whites over those three years would have had to have been killed for them to have been at equal risk. The number is jarring  —   185, more than one per week.” The disparities appear to be even starker for unarmed suspects, according to an analysis of 2015 police killings by the Guardian. Racial minorities made up about 37. 4 percent of the general population and 46. 6 percent of armed and unarmed victims, but they made up 62. 7 percent of unarmed people killed by police.       There have been several   police killings since 2014 involving black suspects. In Baltimore, six police officers were indicted for the death of Freddie Gray while in police custody. In North Charleston, South Carolina, Michael Slager was charged with murder and fired from the police department after shooting Walter Scott, who was fleeing and unarmed at the time. In Ferguson, Darren Wilson killed unarmed    Michael Brown. In New York City, NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo killed Eric Garner by putting the unarmed    black man in a chokehold. One possible explanation for the racial disparities: subconscious biases. Studies show that officers are quicker to shoot black suspects in video game simulations. Josh Correll, a University of Colorado Boulder psychology professor who conducted the research, said it’s possible the bias could lead to even more skewed outcomes in the field. ”In the very situation in which [officers] most need their training,” he said, ”we have some reason to believe that their training will be most likely to fail them.” Part of the solution to this type of bias is better training that helps cops acknowledge and deal with their potential subconscious prejudices. But critics also argue that more accountability could help deter future brutality or excessive use of force, since it would make it clear that there are consequences to the misuse and abuse of police powers. Yet right now, lax legal standards make it difficult to legally punish individual police officers for use of force, even when it might be excessive. Police only have to reasonably perceive a threat to justify shooting              Legally, what most matters in these shootings is whether police officers reasonably believed that their lives were in danger, not whether the shooting victim actually posed a threat.    In the 1980s, a pair of Supreme Court decisions  —   Tennessee v. Garner and Graham v. Connor  —   set up a framework for determining when deadly force by cops is reasonable. Constitutionally, ”police officers are allowed to shoot under two circumstances,” David Klinger, a University of Missouri St. Louis professor who studies use of force, told Vox’s Dara Lind. The first circumstance is ”to protect their life or the life of another innocent party”  —   what departments call the ”  ” standard. The second circumstance is to prevent a suspect from escaping, but only if the officer has probable cause to think the suspect poses a dangerous threat to others. The logic behind the second circumstance, Klinger said, comes from a Supreme Court decision called Tennessee v. Garner. That case involved a pair of police officers who shot a    boy as he fled from a burglary. (He’d stolen $10 and a purse from a house.) The court ruled that cops couldn’t shoot every felon who tried to escape. But, as Klinger said, ”they basically say that the job of a cop is to protect people from violence, and if you’ve got a violent person who’s fleeing, you can shoot them to stop their flight.” WHAT MATTERS IS THE OFFICER’S ”OBJECTIVELY REASONABLE” BELIEF THAT THERE IS A THREAT The key to both of the legal standards  —   defense of life and fleeing a violent felony  —   is that it doesn’t matter whether there is an actual threat when force is used. Instead, what matters is the officer’s ”objectively reasonable” belief that there is a threat. That standard comes from the other Supreme Court case that guides    decisions: Graham v. Connor. This was a civil lawsuit brought by a man who’d survived his encounter with police officers, but who’d been treated roughly, had his face shoved into the hood of a car, and broken his foot  —   all while he was suffering a diabetic attack. The court didn’t rule on whether the officers’ treatment of him had been justified, but it did say that the officers couldn’t justify their conduct just based on whether their intentions were good. They had to demonstrate that their actions were ”objectively reasonable,” given the circumstances and compared to what other police officers might do.    What’s ”objectively reasonable” changes as the circumstances change. ”One can’t just say, ’Because I could use deadly force 10 seconds ago, that means I can use deadly force again now,’” Walter Katz, a California attorney who specializes in oversight of law enforcement agencies, said. In general, officers are given lot of legal latitude to use force without fear of punishment. The intention behind these legal standards is to give police officers leeway to make   decisions to protect themselves and bystanders. And although critics argue that these legal standards give law enforcement a license to kill innocent or unarmed people, police officers say they are essential to their safety. For some critics, the question isn’t what’s legally justified but rather what’s preventable. ”We have to get beyond what is legal and start focusing on what is preventable. Most are preventable,” Ronald Davis, a former police chief who heads the Justice Department’s Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, told the Washington Post. Police ”need to stop chasing down suspects, hopping fences, and landing on top of someone with a gun,” he added. ”When they do that, they have no choice but to shoot.” Police rarely get prosecuted for shootings   Police are very rarely prosecuted for shootings  —   and not just because the law allows them wide latitude to use force on the job. Sometimes the investigations fall onto the same police department the officer is from, which creates major conflicts of interest. Other times the only available evidence comes from eyewitnesses, who may not be as trustworthy in the public eye as a police officer. ”There is a tendency to believe an officer over a civilian, in terms of credibility,” David Rudovsky, a civil rights lawyer who   Prosecuting Misconduct: Law and Litigation, told Vox’s Amanda Taub. ”And when an officer is on trial, reasonable doubt has a lot of bite. A prosecutor needs a very strong case before a jury will say that somebody who we generally trust to protect us has so seriously crossed the line as to be subject to a conviction.” If police are charged, they’re very rarely convicted. The National Police Misconduct Reporting Project analyzed 3, 238 criminal cases against police officers from April 2009 through December 2010. They found that only 33 percent were convicted, and only 36 percent of officers who were convicted ended up serving prison sentences. Both of those are about half the rate at which members of the public are convicted or incarcerated.        ’ );
      >    The numbers suggest that it would have been a truly rare situation if the officer who shot and killed Rice was charged and convicted of a crime. But at least with the lawsuit settlement, the family may get some closure for the shooting.  Watch: Why it’s so important to film police   "
Why do traffic jams sometimes form for no reason?	2014-11-24	2014	11	 If you’ve ever driven on a highway, you’ve probably seen it happen. Traffic slows to a crawl, then stops entirely. Minutes later, it begins to move again, and then suddenly, you’re moving at full speed.    The weirdest part: there’s no construction, accident, or other possible explanation for the traffic. Why does this happen? As it turns out, a few different groups of researchers have been using mathematical calculations and   experiments to try answering this question. And they think they have the answer. They also have suggestions on how to stop these jams. Why phantom traffic jams form If there are enough cars on a highway, any minor disruptions to the flow of traffic can cause a   chain reaction: one car brakes slightly, and the ones behind it brake just a bit more to avoid hitting it, with the braking eventually amplifying until it produces a wave of stopped or slowed traffic.    ”These traffic waves arise from small perturbations in a uniform traffic flow, like a bump in the road, or a driver braking after a moment of inattention,” says Benjamin Seibold, a mathematician at Temple University who’s worked with colleagues on understanding the phenomenon.    one car brakes slightly, and the ones behind it brake just a bit more Even when cars leave this traffic wave, though, the wave itself doesn’t disappear: it gradually drifts backward, against the direction of traffic. ”It’s typically 100 to 1000 meters long, and it usually begins with vehicles running into a sudden increase in density at the start, and a drop in velocity,” Seibold says. ”Then, after that, they slowly accelerate again.”    He and others developed the concept of these waves (which they call jamitons, because they’re analogous to waves in physics called solitons) using computer algorithms that simulate driving behavior:                                      (Seibold et. al.) Japanese researchers have also conducted   experiments that come to the same conclusion. In one, they instructed 22 drivers to drive at the same speed (18. 6 mph) and preserve the same amount of space between cars, on a small circular road. Inevitably, traffic waves formed:  So who’s to blame for these traffic jams? In one sense, it seems reasonable to blame these phantom traffic jams on individual drivers. The models indicate that these jams are more likely to form when people drive as fast as possible, then finally brake when necessary to avoid hitting the car in front of them, triggering a chain reaction.    ”If people anticipate higher traffic densities ahead, and take their feet off the gas earlier and leave more room in front of them  —   instead of waiting until they have to brake  —   that can prevent traffic jams from arising,” Seibold says. Another way to think of it, says Berthold Horn  —   an MIT computer scientist who’s worked on the same topic  —   is to try driving so that you stay halfway between the car in front of you and the one behind you. This will lead to you avoid sudden braking when possible.           (Justin   Images) On the other hand, this sort of behavioral change doesn’t totally eliminate phantom traffic jams  —   it merely makes them less likely to form (specifically, it means that a higher density of cars on the road is required for traffic waves to develop). But if there are enough cars on the road, even if people anticipate approaching traffic to the best of their abilities, phantom traffic jams will form. ”We’re usually inclined to think that these must be caused by an individual driver,” Seibold says. ”But the models show that even if all drivers drive by the exact same rules, and no one does anything wrong, these waves can still arise.” These jams, in essence, emerge whenever you have enough humans driving cars on a highway. So the only real way to eliminate them probably involves handing the wheel over to something other than a human driver. The solution to phantom traffic jams           A prototype of Google’s   car. (Google)    In the short term, there are some things engineers can do to cut down on these traffic jams. The straighter and smoother a road is, the less likely the jams are to form, since it means drivers won’t be doing as much sudden braking. Most highways are already built to be as straight as possible, so it’s mainly by better maintaining current ones that this can make a difference.   cars can anticipate   more effectively than humans A more innovative idea, Seibold says, are variable speed limits, which are already in place in a few places in the US (but are mainly used to alter speeds based on  weather conditions). Using LED signs, speed limits could be decreased in the area leading in to a phantom traffic jam, causing cars to slow down gradually, rather than all at once. In some cases, this could break up the wave. Finally, Seibold believes a comprehensive solution will come in the form of   cars. Because they’ll be able to control their speeds with more precision and use data on traffic miles down the road, they’ll be able to anticipate   much more effectively than any human. One car suddenly braking, for instance, could send out a signal to all the cars within a mile behind it, instructing them to slow down gradually, rather than suddenly when they arrive at the nascent traffic wave. In theory, at least, this will smooth out waves of traffic before they’re able to form.    
Alex Chinneck’s mind-bending buildings	2014-11-25	2014	11	 (CNN) In South London, a   wax house is melting. In the city’s busy Covent Garden shopping piazza, a building floated above the ground. A   walk away, a townhouse is flipped on its head.  No, you’re not hallucinating. These are the most recent irreverent installations from Alex Chinneck, the British artist making a name for himself with   works that appeal to the imagination and beg for a  . For the past year, he’s been achieving this through architecture.  ”Architecture is the fabric and surroundings of our daily and habitual environments,” says Chinneck, 30. ”It provides a very good canvas for creative exploration and abstraction.”  An architectural chapter  When I meet with Chinneck at his psychiatric    in Hackney (seriously) Take My Lighting, But Don’t Steal my Thunder    the polystyrene building floating above Covent Garden    has just been taken down after its   run.  ”It was on the national news in 24 countries that piece, and footfall was up 18 percent in respect to trade and the piazza.

Read: 10 works of art that shocked the world, The floating building is part of what Chinneck calls the ”architectural chapter” of his career, which has born four   installations that use the materials, language and shapes associated with the craft. Though he’d previously used construction materials to create small sculptures, he only recently started working on a larger scale, partly inspired by Rachel Whiteread’s House (a concrete mold of a Victorian house that won the Turner Prize in 1993) and the installations of Richard Wilson. ”It just made sense to integrate those creative explorations into an architectural context and scale, back to where they belonged.”  Making the familiar strange  What makes Chinneck’s work distinctive    other than its obvious   properties    is how each one seems both at home and out of place in its surrounding neighborhood. A Pound of Flesh for 50p, built in Southwark as part of Merge Festival, would look like a typical Georgian house were it not made of wax and melting a little more each day. The floating building looks like a part of the    market has just been plucked and suspended in mid air.

The material and visual decisions are informed by the district and the area and the architectural language of that region,” he explains. ”The concepts are extremely considered despite their playfulness and simplicity. They’re tailored to their environment and their audience.”  His installation in Covent Garden, for example, needed to speak to the piazza’s high levels or foot traffic and tourists to please the commissioning landlords.  ”The demographic through the piazza is incredibly eclectic, but it’s very   and recreational. People come and go, take a photo and move on, so the artwork had to deliver an impact for the Instagram generation.” This last phrase seems to sum up his installations well. The pieces are difficult to execute, simple to enjoy and, he insists, free of any particular meaning or concept. The priority is public enjoyment. Conceptually light, sculpturally complex  The response to the floating house, as well as his other works, has been overwhelmingly positive. Along with comments   Chinneck says he regularly receives emails, tweets and links to articles from people who have enjoyed his installations.

He’s grown immune to accusations that his work is pointless, a waste of taxpayers’ money, or, alternately, a waste of private commissioners’ money, but he’s still occasionally frustrated by the assumption that his work is easy or banal because of its simplicity and lack of intellectual intent.   ”I don’t understand at what point the experience needed this intellectual justification to be an important and valuable one,” he says. ”I’m often criticized for this lack of conceptual content. But what we lose in conceptual content we make up for in structural and sculptural complexity.” (To wit: The floating house took eight months to realize, and had over 100 people involved from design to construction, The melting house    which was commissioned, designed and constructed concurrently    required about 75 people to take care of wax fabrication, carpentry, steelwork, painting and  .)

The new threat: ’Racism without racists’	2014-11-26	2014	11	 (CNN) In a classic study on race, psychologists staged an experiment with two photographs that produced a surprising result. They showed people a photograph of two white men fighting, one unarmed and another holding a knife. Then they showed another photograph, this one of a white man with a knife fighting an unarmed   man. When they asked people to identify the man who was armed in the first picture, most people picked the right one. Yet when they were asked the same question about the second photo, most people    black and white    incorrectly said the black man had the knife. Even before it was announced that a grand jury had decided not to indict a white police officer in the shooting death of an unarmed black teen in Ferguson, Missouri, leaders were calling once again for a ”national conversation on race.”  But here’s why such conversations rarely go anywhere: Whites and racial minorities speak a different language when they talk about racism, scholars and psychologists say. The knife fight experiment hints at the language gap. Some whites confine racism to intentional displays of racial hostility. It’s the Ku Klux Klan, racial slurs in public, something ”bad” that people do.  But for many racial minorities, that type of racism doesn’t matter as much anymore, some scholars say. They talk more about the racism uncovered in the knife fight photos    it doesn’t wear a hood, but it causes unsuspecting people to see the world through a racially biased lens. It’s what one Duke University sociologist calls ”racism without racists.”  Eduardo   who’s written a book by that title, says it’s a new way of maintaining white domination in places like Ferguson. ”The main problem nowadays is not the folks with the hoods, but the folks dressed in suits,” says  . ”The more we assume that the problem of racism is limited to the Klan, the birthers, the tea party or to the Republican Party, the less we understand that racial domination is a collective process and we are all in this game.” As people talk about what the grand jury’s decision in Ferguson means,   and others say it’s time for Americans to update their language on racism to reflect what it has become and not what it used to be. The conversation can start, they say, by reflecting on three phrases that often crop up when whites and racial minorities talk about race. ’I don’t see color’ It’s a phrase some white people invoke when a conversation turns to race. Some apply it to Ferguson. They’re not particularly troubled by the grand jury’s decision to not issue an indictment. The racial identities of Darren Wilson, the white police officer, and Michael Brown, the black man he killed, shouldn’t matter, they say. Let the legal system handle the decision without  . Justice should be colorblind.  Science has bad news, though, for anyone who claims to not see race: They’re deluding themselves, say several bias experts. A body of scientific research over the past 50 years shows that people notice not only race but gender, wealth, even weight.  When babies are as young as 3 months old, research shows they start preferring to be around people of their own race, says Howard J. Ross, author of ”Everyday Bias,” which includes the story of the knife fight experiment. Other studies confirm the power of racial bias, Ross says. One study conducted by a Brigham Young University economics professor showed that white NBA referees call more fouls on black players, and black referees call more fouls on white players. Another study that was published in the American Journal of Sociology showed that newly released white felons experience better job hunting success than young black men with no criminal record, Ross says. ”Human beings are consistently, routinely and profoundly biased,” Ross says. The knife fight experiment reveals that even racial minorities are not immune to racial bias, Ross says. ”The overwhelming number of people will actually experience the black man as having the knife because we’re more open to the notion of the black man having a knife than a white man, ” Ross says. ”This is one of the most insidious things about bias. People may absorb these things without knowing them.” Another famous experiment shows how racial bias can shape a person’s economic prospects. Professors at the University of Chicago and MIT sent 5, 000 fictitious resumes in response to 1, 300 help wanted ads. Each resume listed identical qualifications except for one variation    some applicants had   names such as ”Brendan,” while others had   names such as ”Jamal.” Applicants with   names were 50% more likely to get calls for interviews than their   counterparts.  Most of the people who didn’t call ”Jamal” were probably unaware that their decision was motivated by racial bias, says Daniel L. Ames, a UCLA researcher who has studied and written about bias. ”If you ask someone on the hiring committee, none of them are going to say they’re racially biased,” Ames says. ”They’re not lying. They’re just wrong.” Ames says such biases are dangerous because they’re often unseen. ”Racial biases can in some ways be more destructive than overt racism because they’re harder to spot, and therefore harder to combat,” he says. Still, some people are suspicious of focusing on the word bias. They prefer invoking the term racism because they say it leaves bruises. People claiming bias can admit they may have acted in racially insensitive ways but were unaware of their subconscious motivations. ”The idea of calling it racial bias lessens the blow,” says Crystal Moten, a history professor at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. ”Do you want to lessen the blow or do you want to eradicate racism? I want to eradicate racism,” she says. ”Yes I want opportunity for dialogue, but the impact of racism is killing people of color. We don’t have time to tend to the emotional wounds of others, not when violence against people of color is the national status quo.” ’But I have black friends’ In the movie ”The Godfather,” the character of Michael Corleone, played by Al Pacino, hatches an audacious plan to kill a mobster and a crooked cop who tried to kill his father. Michael’s elders scoff at his plans because they believe his judgment is clouded by anger. But in a line that would define his ruthless approach to wielding power, Michael tells them: ”It’s not personal. It’s strictly business.” When some whites talk about racism, they think it’s only personal    what one person says or does to another. But many minorities and people who study race say racism can be impersonal, calculating, devoid of malice    such as Michael Corleone’s approach to power. ”The first thing we must stop doing is making racism a personal thing and understand that it is a system of advantage based on race,” says Doreen E. Loury, director of the Pan African Studies program at Arcadia University, near Philadelphia. Loury says racism ”permeates every facet of our societal pores.” ”It’s about more than that cop who targets a teen while ’WWB’ (walking while black) but the system that makes it OK to not only stop him but to put him in a system that will target and limit his life chances for life,” she says. Racial bias is so deeply engrained in people that it can manifest itself in surprising places, says Charles Gallagher, a sociologist at La Salle University in Philadelphia. He gave a hypothetical example: ”A white police officer in Ferguson may be married to a black woman and have black and Latino friends, but that doesn’t mean the officer is above racial profiling,” Gallagher says. These old and new ways of talking about racism can be seen in how some whites and blacks perceive the events in Ferguson. Many have already looked at them as something beyond a personal interaction between a white police officer and a young black man. They point out that   of Ferguson’s population is black, yet the mayor, police chief and five of six city council members are white    as are 50 of the 53 people in its Police Department. Ferguson is like countless multiracial communities, they say: calm on the surface but seething with racial disparities beneath. But those disparities are invisible to many whites, who often see themselves as victims of discrimination, writes Jamelle Bouie of Slate magazine in a recent essay, ”The Gulf That Divides Us.”  ”Median income among black Americans is roughly half that of white Americans. But a narrow majority of whites believe blacks earn as much money as whites, and just 37% believe that there’s a disparity between the two groups. Likewise, while 56% of blacks believe black Americans face significant discrimination, only 16% of whites agree,” he writes. ”Many whites    including many millennials    believe discrimination against whites is more prevalent than discrimination against blacks.” But as Nicholas Kristof recently pointed out in The New York Times, the U. S. has a greater wealth gap between whites and blacks than South Africa had during apartheid.  Such racial inequities might seem invisible partly because segregated housing patterns mean that many   and   whites live far from poor blacks.  It’s also no longer culturally acceptable to be openly racist in the United States, says   author of ”Racism Without Racists.”  Overt racism is so widely rejected in America that a white supremacist in Montana recently announced that he is creating a new inclusive Ku Klux Klan chapter that will not discriminate against people because of their color or sexual orientation. Instead, according to one report, the chapter’s new mission will be to prevent a ”new world order” where one government controls everything.  Another recent article revealed how white supremacists in America are facing such hostility at home that some have moved to Europe in an attempt to link up with   groups.  ”The new racism, like God, works in mysterious ways and is quite effective in maintaining white privilege,”   says. ”For example, instead of saying as they used to say during the Jim Crow era that they do not want us as neighbors, they say things nowadays such as ’I am concerned about crime, property values and schools.’ ” ’Who you calling a racist?’ When protests erupted in Ferguson after the shooting this summer, various white and black residents tried to talk about race, but such discussions didn’t bear fruit because of another reason: People refuse to admit their biases, research has consistently shown. Ross, author of ”Everyday Bias,” cited a Dartmouth College survey where misinformed voters were presented with factual information that contradicted their political biases. There were voters, for example, who were disappointed with President Obama’s economic record and believed he hadn’t added any jobs during his presidency. They were shown a graph of nonfarm employment over the prior year that included a rising line indicating about a million jobs had been added. ”They were asked whether the number of people with jobs had gone up, down, or stayed about the same,” Ross wrote. ”Many, looking straight at the graph, said down.” Ross says it’s even more difficult to get smart people to admit bias. ”The smarter we are, the more   we are, and the more successful we are, the less likely we’re going to question our own thinking,” Ross says. Some of the nation’s smartest legal minds aren’t big believers in racial bias either, and that could complicate efforts in Ferguson to reduce racial tensions. Some say they could be eased by hiring more officers of color in Ferguson’s police force. But the conservative majority on the U. S. Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice John Roberts, has been suspicious of efforts to achieve diversity in workforces, believing that they amount to reverse racism or racial preferences, legal observers say. Some fear the court is about to get rid of one of the most effective legal tools for addressing racial bias. The court recently took up a fair housing case in Texas where the conservative majority could very well rule against the concept of ”disparate impact,” a legal approach that doesn’t try to plumb the racist intentions of individuals or businesses but looks at the racial impact of their decisions.  Disparate impact is built on the belief that most people aren’t stupid enough to openly announce they’re racists but instead cloak their racism in seemingly   language. It also recognizes that some ostensibly   policies could reflect unintentional bias. A disparate impact lawsuit, for instance, wouldn’t have to prove that a police department’s white leaders are racist    it would only have to show the impact of having all white officers in an almost   town. Roberts distilled his approach to race in one of the court’s most controversial cases in 2007. The court ruled   along ideological lines that a public school district in Seattle couldn’t consider race when assigning students to schools, even for the purposes of integration. ”The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race,” Roberts said in what is arguably his most famous quote. Roberts has equated affirmative action programs with Jim Crow laws, says Erwin Chemerinsky, author of ”The Case Against the Supreme Court.” ”Chief Justice Roberts has expressly said that the Constitution and the government should be colorblind,” Chemerinsky says. ”He sees no difference between government action that discriminates against minorities and one that benefits minorities.” What that means for Ferguson is that any aggressive attempt to integrate the police force could be struck down in court, says Mark D. Naison, an   Studies professor at Fordham University in New York City. Unless a lawyer can find   evidence of some police department official saying he won’t hire blacks, people won’t have much legal leverage to make the police department diverse, he says. ”Once the doctrine of disparate impact is weakened, you have to prove discriminatory intent in order to declare a practice discriminatory,” Naison says. ”Huge racial disparities in law enforcement can be tolerated if they are the result of policies which are   in how they are written in the law even through the implementation is anything but.” The courts may ignore colorblind racism, but ordinary people ought to be aware of it when they talk about racism, others say. Ross, author of ”Everyday Bias,” says being biased doesn’t make people bad, just human. He says people are hardwired to be biased because it helped keep our ancestors alive. They survived, in part, by having to make quick assumptions about strangers who might prove threatening. ”We need to reduce the level of guilt but increase the level of responsibility we take for it,” he says. ”I didn’t choose to internalize these messages, but it’s inside of me and I have to be careful.” Part of being careful is expanding our definition of racism, says   author of ”Racism Without Racists.” Racism has evolved, but our language for describing it hasn’t, he says. ”Colorblind racism is the new racial music most people dance to,” he says. ”The ’new racism’ is subtle, institutionalized and seemingly nonracial.” How long before another Ferguson erupts is anyone’s guess. But if and when it does, the knife fight experiment suggests that before people look at videotapes, read police reports and listen to radio talk shows to form their opinions, they should do something else first: Look within themselves.

A Progressive Guide to Thanksgiving Conversation	2014-11-26	2014	11	In the great progressive spirit, here are a few tips on how to talk to  —   and morally improve  —   your family this Thanksgiving: 1. Your crazy uncle complains in passing that the construction on Redlands Avenue is limiting the flow of traffic to his hardware store, and wonders if the job could be completed more quickly. Remind him also that:  the state has a monopoly on legitimate violence. Europe is doing really well. The Koch Brothers. “Obstruction. ” 2. Your younger sister asks you to pass her the turkey from your end of the table your older brother asks if you will pour him another glass of the wine you brought to the meal. Explain to your siblings that you are not a maid just because you have a vagina. Ask them if they have even considered the gender binary lately. Refuse to hand anything over until you have been given verbal acknowledgement that the person requesting service understands the health consequences of        choices. A particularly effective way of keeping the attention of those who ask for alcohol at family gatherings is to pull a couple charts from the latest NIH studies on substance abuse. Given that the topic has now come up, make sure to ask your interlocutors whether they consider themselves to be “evangelists for Obamacare. ” (Should they call it Obamacare, again, see your Fact Cards for a   connection.) If they admit that they do not, inquire as to why they are so indifferent to women of color. At this point, it is acceptable to start screaming. Those asking for more meat should be informed as politely as possible that they are no better than murderers and that the production of   foodstuffs is extremely harmful to the environment. Note that those who compliment the turkey essentially wish Indonesian children to drown. Remind those at the table that you are a fruitarian and that you have been gluten free for 47 days straight now. To avoid having to repeat these steps during each and every course, sneak out on the perfectly normal and socially acceptable pretext that you are going to have a   abortion and throw all the sugary desserts into the garbage. Goodbye transfats. 3. Your    expresses the view that the United States is a “great country” and that he is “lucky” to live here. Most likely, your   ’s admiration for his country is nothing more than an expression of his white, straight,               assimilationist,   privilege. Say “I can’t even” so that all present will understand that you are serious. Next, consider   comments about all those who are not able to enjoy a warm meal today: among them, Native Americans, slaves, transgender animals, otherkins, the homeless, and the victims of America’s many foreign wars. Point out that the United States cannot be that great if it is fifth in global zinc production and people are still permitted to buy SUVs. Ask aloud why America is the only country in the world that hasn’t been progressive enough to submit its Bill of Rights to a majority of the voters. If anyone in your extended family has moved here from another country, ensure that you educate them about the downsides of their adopted home before it is too late. Lament the false consciousness of the American voter. Note that you feel sorry for the young people in your family. Correct anyone who disagrees by saying the word “Fox. ” Demand to know why your “empowered and beautiful” sister married a Republican. 4. Somebody around the table suggests that “we should say grace. ” Insist that you are permitted to say a few words first, for balance. Use the opportunity to read the entirety of Richard Dawkins’s The God Delusion  —   in Spanish. Administer a test to ensure that those present have listened and have absorbed its message. If you can record this and post it to Reddit, that is even better. If not, do not worry. There will be another chance next year. Finish your moment with a brief spiritual reading from the Hadiths. More Thanksgiving   in the WildernessBe Thankful You Have Something to Grumble AtAll the Best, 5. Your grandfather tells a hunting story. Danger! This means that, somewhere in the house, your grandfather must have a gun. Panic immediately. After noting that any parents who brought their children to the gathering are irresponsible, find the firearms and the ammunition and inspect them all personally. Read your grandfather a safety briefing, as prepared by Moms Demand Action’s Shannon Watts. If he protests, remind him that his many tours in Vietnam do not constitute sufficient weapons training and that, anyway, Vietnam actually has a lower murder rate than the United States. If your grandfather has locked his firearms inside a safe in the basement, make him open it so that you can tell him indignantly to keep the guns locked and inaccessible. 6. The men decide it’s time to watch some football. Football is a violent, regressive game that encourages   and leads to the exploitation of the poor. Worse, men’s enthusiasm for it only reinforces gender stereotypes and the   .

How Dogs Understand What We Say	2014-11-28	2014	11	Scientists  —   and anyone who lives with a canine  —   know that dogs pay close attention to the emotion in our voices. They listen for whether our tone is friendly or mean, how the pitch goes up or down and even the rhythms in our speech. But what about the meaning of the words we say? Sure, a few studies have reported on supersmart dogs that know hundreds of words. Chaser, a border collie in South Carolina, even learned 1, 022 nouns and commands to go with them. But otherwise, there’s little evidence that dogs differentiate between speech with meaningful words and sounds that contain only inflections, says neurobiologist Attila Andics at the   Comparative Ethology Research Group in Budapest. ”We know quite a bit about how much dogs get about how we say things,” Andics says, ”but we know quite little about how much dogs get about what we say to them.” That’s about to change. Psychologists reported Wednesday in the journal Current Biology that dogs do pay attention to the meanings of words. And they process that information in a different part of the brain from where they process emotional cues in speech. To figure that out, graduate student Victoria Ratcliffe at the University of Sussex in England set up a clever experiment. She brought 250 dogs into the lab. And then for each one, Ratcliffe put a speaker on either side of the dog’s head. Then she played the command ”to come” out of both speakers, at the same time. At first, the command sounded normal. It had both meaningful words and emotional cues in it. Then Ratcliffe started to manipulate the speech in the command. In some instances, she removed all of the inflections in the speaker’s voice. In other instances, she kept the inflections in the speaker’s voice but removed the words (or replaced the words with gibberish). For each command, Ratcliffe recorded which way the dogs turned their heads  —   toward the left speaker or toward the right speaker. Even though both speakers were playing the same sounds, a clear pattern emerged. When the dogs heard commands that still had meaningful words in them, about 80 percent of the animals turned to the right. When they heard commands with just emotional cues in them, most dogs turned to the left. That result sounds simple. But Andics, who wasn’t involved in the study, says the findings show something surprising: ”that dogs are able to differentiate between meaningful and meaningless sound sequences.” The study also suggests that a dog’s brain breaks up speech into two parts: the emotional cues and the meaning of the words. Then it processes these two components on opposite sides of the brain: emotional cues on the right, meaning of words on the left. (Yes, it’s opposite to the way the dogs turned.) That’s a bit similar to how we humans process speech. We also break up speech into several parts, such as the meaning of the words, clues about the speaker and emotional cues. ”But with humans, it’s trickier,” Andics says. ”We believe the human brain processes various aspects of human speech in different stages and in many different parts of the brain.” Still, though, Andics says the new study offers one way that people may be able to communicate better with their best friends: Pick the ear you use carefully. ”Tell all the emotional things to the dog in his left ear,” Andics says. ”For commands that you want a dog to get clearly and precisely, tell them in right ear.”
Stunning geometric shapes appear in snow on frozen, isolated lakes	2014-12-01	2014	12	 (CNN) If you frequent the pistes of the French Alps, you may see more than just skiers and snowmen scattered around the trails below. For the last 10 years, British artist Simon Beck has been decorating   lakes and mountainsides with massive geometric designs, often based on fractal patterns, using his footsteps as his implement.   Beck’s snow drawings have attracted attention and opportunity beyond the Les Arcs ski resort in France where he got his start. This year alone, he’s delivered TED Talks in Austria and Cyprus, collaborated with New Zealand clothing brand Icebreaker on a series of garments, and has seen his international Facebook following grow to 280, 000. Now he adds Snow Art, a book of over 200 photos he has taken of his work, to his list of accomplishments. From engineering, to orienteering, to art, Beck’s journey to art was unconventional. He was working as an orienteering cartographer when he made his first snow drawing, and before that the Oxford graduate was an engineer. He created his first snow drawing, a star on a lake near his apartment at Les Arcs, to pass the time after a day of skiing in 2004. Read: How did this human face appear in a gemstone? ”When I did my first drawing, I had no idea how good it was going to look,” he says. ”It’s just so unusual and unique. No one else is doing anything like it.”  But it wasn’t until five years ago, when he recognized the toll that his frequent orienteering trips had taken on his feet, that he started to take his drawings seriously.  ”I realized that it would probably be better to do something a bit easier than orienteering, and do something less painful,” he says. Snow drawing went from an occasional hobby to his primary form of exercise during the winter months. One hundred and fifty snow drawings later, quite a few things have changed. Where he was once restricted to scouting locations and photographing his work from mountain tops and ski lifts, he can now afford to work out of an aircraft if he chooses instead of winter boots, he now wears snowshoes. His work has gone from a fairly solitary pleasure to something enjoyed by thousands online. Read: Aerial photos capture the eerie geometry of everyday life, However, his techniques have remained the same. Beck still walks as many as 30 km across distances as large as six soccer fields, counting each pace as he would while orienteering, armed with nothing but a compass and a map he designed himself. A single drawing can still take as long as 12 hours to realize. But he now has his art down to science. Beck knows the best terrain (thoroughly frozen lakes) the best time to shoot (just before the drawing goes into shadow at the end of the day) and the best conditions (sunny, at least one foot of snow). He can now shift his focus from creating the perfect drawing to pushing himself creatively.  Exploring new territory, Earlier this year, Beck spent time in New Zealand and Somerset Beach in the UK creating sand drawings, raking complex designs into the sand to be washed away by encroaching tides. Fans have suggested that he try his hand at working in mud or deserts, or even try mowing a lawn, but he’d most like to try his hand at creating crop formations. He’d also like to start exploring more remote lakes in the towns surrounding the Alps, like Zermatt, Switzerland. Read: Making   images with nothing but marker pens, ”And there are other places I’d just like to (try) because of the location, like Central Park in New York. I’d love to do a drawing there, or on the grounds of the White House, Buckingham Palace gardens, or the parks in London,” he adds. ”If you ever got the conditions to be right, it would be fantastic to go and do something like that, and get famous buildings in the background.”  Snow Art by Simon Beck ( ) is available for purchase online at snowart. gallery.

Eating the Mediterranean diet may lead to a longer life	2014-12-03	2014	12	 (CNN) Eating a Mediterranean diet may be your key to living longer. That’s according to a new study led by Immaculata De Vivo, associate professor at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston and Harvard Medical School.  The diet involves eating items off a menu that is rich in vegetables, fruits, nuts, beans and peas, unrefined grains, olive oil and fish. It keeps dairy, meat and saturated fats to a minimum. And you can have a glass of red wine with dinner without cheating. Can meditation really slow aging? The diet has been consistently linked with health benefits that includes helping you manage your weight, and it can lower your risk for chronic issues such as cardiovascular disease.  This new research looks at data from 4, 676 healthy   women involved in the Nurses’ Health Study, an ongoing study tracking the health of more than 120, 000 U. S. nurses since 1976.  It found women who ate a Mediterranean diet had longer telomeres.  A Mediterranean diet prevents strokes, Telomeres are part of your chromosomes, the   structures that house your DNA.  At the end of these chromosomes are telomeres, a kind of protective ”cap” that keeps the structure from unraveling. It thereby protects your genetic information.  Even in healthy people, telomeres shorten with age. Shorter telomeres are associated with aging, lower life expectancy and   diseases such as artherosclerosis, certain cancers and liver disease.  Scientists have noticed some lifestyle choices such as smoking, being overweight or obese and drinking a lot of sugar sweetened drinks can prematurely shorten a person’s telomeres.   Scientists believe oxidative stress and inflammation can also shorten them.  How to get super fit at any age, Fruits, vegetables, olive oils and nuts    the key components of a Mediterranean diet    have   antioxidant and   effects. The team of U. S. researchers led by De Vivo therefore wanted to see whether the women who stuck with this diet had longer telomeres.  ”This is the largest   study addressing the association between Mediterranean diet adherence and telomere length in healthy, middle aged women,” they write. The study included completed detailed food questionnaires and blood tests to measure telomere length.  Each participant had a calculated diet score ranging from 0 to 9 points a higher score signifies a closer resemblance to the Mediterranean diet. Each one point change in diet score corresponded an average of 1. 5 years of telomere aging. Telomere shortening is irreversible but healthy ”lifestyle choices can help prevent accelerated shortening,” says De Vivo.  Healthy aging, four keys, This study’s results provide ”some insight into the underlying physiologic mechanism behind this association,” indicating that greater adherence to this diet is significantly associated with longer telomeres, she says. Because of the antioxidant and   effects of the Mediterranean diet, following this diet ”could balance out the ’bad effects’ of smoking and obesity,” De Vivo says.  These findings further support ”the health benefits of greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet for reduction of overall mortality, increased longevity and reduced incidence of chronic diseases, especially major cardiovascular diseases.”  None of the individual dietary components was associated with telomere length. Researchers suggest that means the whole diet is an important element, rather than one item being a kind of superfood. That sweet drink may age you, Dr. Peter Nilsson, a professor of Clinical Cardiovascular Research at Lund University in Sweden, who wrote an accompanying editorial, suggests that the variation in telomere length and dietary patterns may also be because of genetic background factors.  While promising, Nilsson believes that future studies ”should take into account the possibility of interactions between genes, diet and sex.”   With these results, De Vivo and her research team hope in the future to figure out which components of the Mediterranean diet may be having a bigger impact on telomere length.  Next they also hope to study the same thing in men.
The New Republic is up for sale, but what is its next owner buying?	2014-12-04	2014	12	 When I entered journalism there were three places I badly wanted to work: The American Prospect, the Washington Monthly, and the New Republic. The decision turned out to be easy: TNR never called me back. The Washington Monthly didn’t have   positions. But I got lucky: The Prospect took me on as a writing fellow, and it turned out to be a dream job.    Ten years later, the Prospect, the Monthly, and TNR are all in crisis. The Prospect laid off much of its staff and is retrenching to its roots as a policy journal. The Washington Monthly has downsized to a bimonthly. The New Republic was bought by   Chris Hughes only to become a cautionary tale when Hughes ineptly fired its editor Frank Foer  —   a move that caused massive staff resignations and a devastating backlash from the   laced throughout the rest of the media. Now Hughes is putting the magazine back up for sale. ”I will be the first to admit that when I took on this challenge nearly four years ago, I underestimated the difficulty of transitioning an old and traditional institution into a digital media company in today’s quickly evolving climate,” Hughes wrote in an article that, oddly, was published on Medium rather than the New Republic’s web site.    TNR’s problems have been largely being laid at Hughes’s doorstep. And, to some degree, that’s fair. Transitioning an old and traditional institution into a digital media company is hard, but it’s not as hard as Hughes made it look.    Marty Peretz, who owned the New Republic from 1974 to 2002, fired a slew of editors without causing mass resignations among the staff (though, as my colleague Max Fisher has written, the contrast between the indulgence of Peretz’s racism and the backlash to Hughes does not reflect well on TNR, or journalism more broadly. ). And plenty of other venerable institutions  —   the Atlantic, the Washington Post, the New York Times, National Geographic, etc  —   have made the leap to digital without   tumult.  What happened at the New Republic was a colossal management failure compounded by cultural tensions between the journalism and technology worlds, and it was the job of Hughes, and those he hired, to make sure that didn’t happen.    But, to reprise an argument I made amidst TNR’s 2014 crisis, there’s a deeper story here too. The New Republic was sold to Hughes in the first place because the institution was bleeding so much money that Peretz, its previous owner, couldn’t sustain it. And Hughes’s alarm over the magazine’s future  —   the alarm that led him to bring in Guy Vidra, an   executive, to lead the institution, and that convinced him he needed to fire Foer  —   was based on watching the magazine’s influence wane, its traffic lag behind competitors, and its business prospects dim. Behind the crisis caused by Hughes’s management, in other words, was the crisis that led to Hughes’s management. Twilight of the policy magazines           The American Prospect. TNR. com might flourish under its next owner. But it won’t be what the New Republic was. And that’s because the thing the New Republic was has already died. The eulogy that needs to be written isn’t for the New Republic. It’s for the New Republic and The American Prospect and the Washington Monthly and their peers. It’s for the role once played by Washington’s small fleet of ambitious policy magazines.    This sprawling conversation over Washington policymaking used to be centered in a handful of   policy magazines, of which the New Republic was perhaps the best known and most ambitious. There was policy reporting in the newspapers, of course, but it didn’t go as deep, and it was crippled by the   that is death to any serious conversation over solutions. There were the journals, like The Public Interest, but they came out more rarely, and their tone was often staid and impenetrable. The policy magazines had a number of unique characteristics, but two were central. The first was what they covered  —   which was, for the most part, politics through the lens of policy (though the New Republic, in particular, had an amazing culture section). Policy  —   wrongly, in my view  —   was broadly considered a boring topic in journalism, and so if you wanted to keep large masses of readers engaged, you couldn’t do too much of it, too often. But these magazines could, because they weren’t trying to keep large masses of readers engaged. They were niche products comfortable with small, enthusiastic audiences. They were by people who loved writing about policy and for people who loved reading about policy, and that allowed them to serve their audience in a way   publications couldn’t touch. The second was the angle that animated their coverage. The American Prospect was  . The Washington Monthly was technocratic neoliberalism. The New Republic oscillated from editor to editor, but tended towards a hawkish, contrarian neoliberalism (hence the ”Even the liberal New Republic” meme). The Nation, which is based in New York, and Mother Jones, which is based in San Francisco, were a bit less   but a lot more liberal. On the right, you had (and still have) the National Review, which tended towards conservative fusionism. The Public Interest was the birthplace of neoconservatism, and that mantle was later taken on by the Weekly Standard. (The most interesting policy publication on the right at the moment is Yuval Levin’s   journal National Affairs.) These magazines, in other words, stood for something. That set them apart from newspapers and   magazines, which were carefully neutral in ways that made their coverage both less vibrant and less clear. It’s very, very hard to cover policy topics well if you can’t, at the end, say which solutions you think most promising.    People often talk about the problems of the transition to digital in broad terms, but for policy magazines, the transition to digital created specific problems: namely, the qualities that once set organizations like the New Republic apart were adopted by their bigger, richer competitors. The   reading on Air Force One is probably an iPad           Wha’cha reading? (JEWEL    Images) To the wonk in the 1970s, ’80s, and ’90s, these magazines were the thrumming center of the policy conversation in Washington. That’s why it was believable that the New Republic was the ”  reading on Air Force One.” President Bill Clinton was a policy wonk. What else was he going to read? But they’re no longer the center of the policy conversation in Washington. That conversation has spilled online, beyond their pages, outside their borders. The   reading on Air Force One is probably saved to President Obama’s iPad. And he has much to choose from. The internet is now thick with outlets that pride themselves on covering Washington’s vast policymaking apparatus in much the way the policy magazines once did, and often with staff culled from those same policy magazines.  Vox is one of those outlets, as is the New Republic, but so are the Washington Post’s Wonkblog, the New York Times’ Upshot, Politico, Bloomberg View, and FiveThirtyEight, to name just a few. Many of these publications are attached to bigger institutions that would never have published so much policy, or allowed such   coverage, in their print products. And that doesn’t even include the individual bloggers who are   if you’re following policy: Kevin Drum, and Tyler Cowen, and Brad DeLong, and Paul Krugman, and Ross Douthat, and Ramesh Ponnuru, and Jonathan Chait, and Scott Sumner, and Megan McArdle, and Jonathan Bernstein, and, again, the list goes on. At another time, most of these names would be published inside policy magazines. Now they’re either employed by bigger institutions or forging ahead on their own blogs, supported by foundations, advertising, and speaking fees.    The other problem is on the business side. Hughes believed his charge was to make TNR a viable web publication, in a world where viability  —   and, arguably, influence  —   requires web traffic. That meant publishing more, publishing faster, and publishing the kinds of quick hits and aggregations that help build audience on the cheap. In a strange sentence on his Medium post, Hughes writes, ”Even though our search for a workable business model has come up short, we have shown that digital journalism isn’t at odds with quality and depth.” But if digital journalism of quality and depth is at odds with a workable business model, then digital journalism of quality and depth won’t survive.  This was, according to many accounts, the central tension between Hughes and Foer: Hughes wanted to solve TNR’s business problems in part by increasing the size of its audience, which meant it had to to become more like its   competitors. But many at TNR felt Hughes had promised to preserve the TNR of yore, even if it lost money indefinitely  —   as it had in the past. To them, forcing TNR into a fight for audience was forcing it into a fight that would destroy what made it unique even as it failed to create a model on which TNR could thrive. The New Republic is up for sale, but what is its next owner buying? The New Republic, for better and for worse, has stood for less in recent years. So too do its competitors, who sound a bit more like everyone else and a bit less like themselves. This isn’t a criticism of Foer, who led TNR to publish great journalism. And nor is it a criticism of Snyder, who pushed the magazine in new and interesting directions. But the TNR that stood for so much routinely saw subscriber numbers of 100, 000 or less. It would never fulfill its publisher’s hopes of acquiring tens of millions of monthly digital readers. Behind this fight is a deeper tension in digital journalism: The pressure for convergence is strong    Behind this fight is a deeper tension in digital journalism: The pressure for convergence is strong. We feel it at Vox, and sometimes give into it. It’s easy to see which stories are resonating with readers. It’s obvious that John Oliver videos do big numbers. And that’s fine. Right now, almost all successful digital publications are partially built on internet best practices and partially built on that publication’s particular obsessions, ideas, and attitude. Digital publications need to be smart about their mix of what everyone else does and what no one else does. But what made the New Republic and its peer policy magazines so great was how restlessly, relentlessly idiosyncratic they were  —   that’s how they drove new ideologies and new ideas to the fore. They were worse at covering policy than their digital successors because they were slower and more distant from the news cycle, but they were probably better at thinking. Part of this was because they simply cared less what the audience thought  —   they saw their role as telling their audience what to think, and they expected a readership in the low six or high five figures, not the   figures. That gave them a freedom to truly be themselves that more   publications don’t have. As someone who really loathed a number of TNR’s previous eras (see the Bell Curve, or No Exit, or A Fighting Faith, or much of what Hughes’s predecessor Marty Peretz wrote, for examples) I’m probably a bit less nostalgic for its past. But something is being lost in the transition from policy magazines to policy web sites, and it’s still an open question how much of it can be regained. For TNR, however, the problem is more specific. There’s so much expectation and history attached to the publication that its room for strategic movement is limited  —   as Chris Hughes found out. But an owner who wants to buy and support the TNR of yesteryear is buying into a market that makes it much harder for the TNR of yesteryear to thrive. Related: How the American Prospect changed policy journalism. Correction: This article initially said Marty Peretz was Hughes’s predecessor as owner of the New Republic. Peretz owned the magazine from 1974 to 2002, when he sold majority control to Michael Steinhardt and Roger Hertog. Peretz bought back the magazine later in the decade, and stepped down as    in 2011.

He is not named after author Ayn Rand his nickname was shortened from ”Randy.” Former president and longtime member of the Bowling Green Noon Lions Club. Was active in the congressional and presidential campaigns of his father, Ron Paul. Timeline: 1993   Completes his ophthalmology residency at Duke University Medical Center. 1994   Founds grassroots organization Kentucky Taxpayers United, which monitors state taxation and spending.

August 5, 2009   Announces on Fox News that he is running as a Republican for the US Senate to represent Kentucky. May 18, 2010   Defeats Secretary of State Trey Grayson in the Kentucky GOP Senate primary.  May 19, 2010   In interviews with NPR and MSNBC, while answering questions about the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Paul expresses strong abhorrence for racism, but says that it is the job of communities, not the government, to fix discrimination in private places by boycotting such businesses. Paul later releases a statement saying that he supports the Civil Rights Act and would not support its repeal. November 2, 2010   Tea Party favorite Paul is elected to the US Senate for Kentucky, defeating Jack Conway. January 5, 2011   Sworn in as a U. S. senator from Kentucky for the 112th Congress. It is the first time in congressional history a child serves in the Senate while the parent concurrently serves in the House. Paul’s father, Ron Paul, retired from the House in 2013.

Why your brain loves procrastination	2014-12-08	2014	12	 Tax Day is a horror for many procrastinators. For many people, a little procrastination isn’t harmful  —   like 15 minutes lost in Facebook or putting off doing the laundry for a few days.     But then there are things like taxes. And all the people who keep meaning to start saving for retirement, but never do. And people with obesity or diabetes who constantly tell themselves, ”I’ll start eating right tomorrow”  —   but never do. For some people, procrastination creates huge problems at work, at school, and at home. Roughly 5 percent of the population has such a problem with chronic procrastination that it seriously affects their lives. None of it seems logical. How can people have such good intentions and yet be so totally unable to follow through?    Conventional wisdom has long suggested that procrastination is all about poor time management and willpower. But more recently, psychologists have been discovering that it may have more to do with how our brains and emotions work.    Procrastinators are less compassionate toward themselves Procrastination, they’ve realized, appears to be a coping mechanism. When people procrastinate, they’re avoiding emotionally unpleasant tasks and instead doing something that provides a temporary mood boost. The procrastination itself then causes shame and guilt  —   which in turn leads people to procrastinate even further, creating a vicious cycle.    But getting a better understanding of why our brains are so prone to procrastination might let us find new strategies to avoid it. For example, psychologist Tim Pychyl has   a paper showing that students who forgave themselves for procrastinating on a previous exam were actually less likely to procrastinate on their next test. He and others have also found that people prone to procrastination are, overall, less compassionate toward themselves  —   an insight that points to ways to help. Pychyl, a professor at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada, has been studying procrastinators for some 19 years. I talked to him about why people procrastinate and how they can learn to stop. Susannah Locke: What are the biggest misconceptions about procrastination? Tim Pychyl: When a procrastinator thinks about themselves, they’ll think, ”Oh, I have a time management problem,” or, ”I just can’t make myself do it. There’s a problem with my willpower.” And when other people think about procrastinators, they use that pejorative term: ”They’re lazy.”    ”Psychologists see procrastination as a misplaced coping mechanism” But psychologists see procrastination as a misplaced coping mechanism, as an   coping strategy. [People who procrastinate are] using avoidance to cope with emotions, and many of them are unconscious emotions. So we see it as giving in to feel good. And it’s related to a lack of   skills. I can simplify that and say that psychologists recognize we all have a    running the ship. And the    is saying, ”I don’t want to! I don’t feel like it!” SL: What are you discovering about how procrastinators’ brains work?  TP: Recently we’ve been doing research that relates to the work on ”present self” ”future self” because what’s happening with procrastination is that ”present self” is always trumping ”future self.” Hal Hershfield has done some really great research on looking at how we think about ”future self.” He’s shown that in experimental settings if someone sees their own picture digitally aged, they’re more likely to allocate funds to retirement. When [the researchers] did the fMRI studies, they found our brain processes present self and future self differently. We think of future self more like a stranger. ”If someone sees their own picture digitally aged, they’re more likely to allocate funds to retirement”    My graduate student     just did three studies, and what she looked at is our ability to imagine the future self. She measured people’s  . You’d see circles representing present self and future self and choose how much to overlap them. Some people see these selves as completely distinct, and some people see them totally overlapping. The people who see the present and future self as more overlapping have more   and report less procrastination. She’s doing a study right now using an imagery intervention. So she’s going to have students think of an image of themselves at the end of the term. And the hypothesis is that those students who engage with this imagery of future self will then procrastinate less. We [think] that people will make less procrastinatory choices now because they’ll realize that ”It’s me in the future we’re talking about here. I’m going to be under the gun.” SL: What’s the most surprising thing to you about procrastination? TP: I think the most surprising thing I’m still grappling with is that for many people, the experience of procrastination doesn’t match the definition that most of us are working with: a voluntary delay of an intended action despite knowing you’re going to be worse off for the delay. If you speak to people, they’ll tell you that it doesn’t feel voluntary: ”I feel like I have no control over it.” For some people, it feels totally involuntary, like they can’t help themselves. SL: What’s your one biggest tip for stopping procrastination? TP: One of my pet expressions is, ”Just get started.” And it’s important you don’t say, ”Just do it”  —   that’s overwhelming. But just get started. Whenever we face a task, we’re not going to feel like doing it. Somehow adults believe that their motivational state has to match the task at hand. We say, ”I’m not in the mood.”    Our motivational state rarely matches the task at hand, so we always have to use   skills to bring our focus to it. So at first it will be, ”Okay, I recognize that I don’t feel like it, but I’m just gonna get started.” SL: What’s the evidence that just beginning a task, even in a very small way, makes it easier to follow through? TP: We know from psychological research by [Andrew] Elliot and others that progress on our goals feeds our  . So the most important thing you can do is bootstrap a little progress. Get a little progress, and that’s going to fuel your   and your motivation. Back in the 1990s, I put pagers on students and paged them [eight times a day for five days before an academic deadline]. And when they finally started working on the project, empirically we found that they didn’t see it as as difficult or as stressful as earlier in the week. So their perceptions of the task changed. There’s lots of reasons to think that that’s what happens to us when we get started. SL: But what about getting distracted? TP: [Peter] Gollwitzer and his colleagues for years have shown us that implementation intentions make a huge difference to even deal with things like distractions. Implementation intentions take the form of ”If, then.” ”If the phone rings, then I’m not going to answer it.” ”If my friends call me to say we’re going out, I’m going to say no.” So you’ve already made this  .    You can use implementation intentions to keep yourself focused: ”If I’ve finished this part of the article, then I’m going to immediately turn my attention to reading the next part.” SL: Can people really overcome procrastination? TP: I guess I’m a living case. When I was an undergraduate, I procrastinated a lot. And now that I understand procrastination, I just have no room to wiggle. Because it’s all about    —   you aren’t aware that it’s going to cost you, but you are. When there’s no more   and you face yourself, you either shit or get off the pot. You’re either going to do it, or you’re not going to do it. ”I guess I’m a living case” I really like my life, and I like to make time for the things that are important to me. [Robert] Pozen, who’s written a book on extreme productivity, has the OHIO rule: only handle it once. And I’m like that with email. I look at that email and say, ”I can reply to it now, or I can throw it out,” but there’s not much of a middle ground. I’m not going to save it for a while. And so if I can deal with it in two minutes  —   this is David Allen’s work  —    I deal with it. I used to procrastinate, and now I don’t, because I got all these wicked strategies. And it’s every level: some of it’s behavioral, some of it’s emotional, some of it’s cognitive. And now my biggest challenge is how do I teach my kids this? That’s really hard.

The best Christmas movies aren’t about Christmas	2014-12-08	2014	12	 It’s late December, which means it’s time for TV networks to haul out holiday standards. But what if you’re not in the mood for the kinds of holiday cheer whipped up by A Christmas Story or It’s a Wonderful Life? What if you want to celebrate the season with something a little less filled with cheer, something set during the season but not really of the season?    Well, have you considered something  ? The term, which I first encountered in this essay on Die Hard by Zack Handlen, simply means a story that is set at least in part during the holiday season, but not a story that is dominated by said holidays. It can be an action movie or a horror film. It can even be a downbeat drama. Anything but the usual blast of cheer, and it’s fine. Here, then, are nine   films that might help you get in the holiday spirit . .. but not too much. The Apartment    Billy Wilder’s classic comedy about a man who finds himself embroiled in something awful in order to get ahead at work is a wonderful look at early 1960s gender politics that won the Oscar for Best Picture. Jack Lemmon is terrific in the lead, and Shirley MacLaine is a wonderfully winsome romantic interest. Plus, the movie’s plot intersects with both Christmas and New Year’s, so you get two holidays for the price of one.    Batman Returns  Director Tim Burton often sets his films at Christmastime. (See also: Edward Scissorhands.) But this slice of baroque genius, the   to 1989’s megahit Batman, is positively the perfect film for anyone who wants to examine something a bit more macabre as the season settles in. Plus, its dark, wintry atmosphere is just about perfect for those getting in the seasonal mood.    Die Hard  Weirdly, a lot of action movies are set at Christmas, no matter how incongruous that might seem. Blame action screenwriter and director Shane Black, the man responsible for the script for Lethal Weapon and the direction of films like Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang and Iron Man 3, who loves to set his films at Christmastime. That influence spread to other filmmakers, including those who made Die Hard. This classic action romp, in which John McClane (Bruce Willis) takes down a bunch of terrorists to protect his family, all on Christmas Eve, proves why gunfire and Christmas go together so very well. Ho, ho, ho! Fanny and Alexander  This movie qualifies under the ”films that aren’t about the holidays but have holiday scenes in them” category. Swedish director Ingmar Bergman’s very loose portrayal of his and his sister’s childhood was originally a TV miniseries but retains the feel of an epic in its feature film format, along with one of the most festive, joyous Christmas scenes in all of film. The    feast will almost certainly delight.    Gremlins  There have been a surprising number of horror films set at Christmastime, but this is one of the few that plays as almost gruesomely festive. Joe Dante’s elaborate skewering of    America unleashes a bunch of tiny monsters in the perfect small town as the holidays settle in. It’s gory, goofy, and glorious, and it will ensure you never look at a fireplace quite the same way. Meet Me in St. Louis  This is probably cheating, since it’s the film that actually spawned the song ”Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.” It also has a significant portion of its running time set at a Christmas Eve ball. But this is a terrific movie at capturing the slow turn of the seasons, the way that summer becomes fall becomes winter, and it has a great eye for time and place. (It’s set in St. Louis in 1904.) Maybe too much of this is set at Christmas to really qualify, but it’s still worth seeing anyway. Morvern Callar  This is the one if you have absolutely no wish to engage in holiday cheer. A young woman arrives home on Christmas morning to find that her boyfriend has killed himself. She drifts through the rest of the film in a kind of haze that, nevertheless, makes it seem as if she’s almost more alive for having been so closely touched by death. This movie isn’t for everyone, but Samantha Morton’s lead performance is phenomenal, and the subject matter is decidedly not the typical Christmas movie plot.    The Royal Tenenbaums  Though the closest this film comes to actually saying it’s set during the holidays is one scene featuring ”Christmastime Is Here” from A Charlie Brown Christmas on the soundtrack, it’s one of the most wintry films out there, thanks to its gray skies and story of a family coming together just when they need to most. Plus, Mark Mothersbaugh’s score gives this a decidedly holiday feel, with its frequent sleigh bells and children’s choir oohing away. The Thin Man  Maybe what you need this holiday season is a devilishly clever mystery with even more devilishly clever screwball dialogue. In that case, can I suggest the adventures of Nick and Nora Charles, dashingly sophisticated married sleuths? It’s easy to forget this film is set at Christmastime, given how fun it is, but much of it takes place in and around a Christmas Eve party the Charleses throw, and it adds just the right mood to a mystery that’s as much fun as unwrapping presents.

28  Internet acronyms every parent should know	2014-12-08	2014	12	 (CNN) If you think you are tech savvy all because you know what ”LOL” means, let me test your coolness. Any idea what ”IWSN” stands for in Internet slang? It’s a declarative statement: I want sex now. If it makes you feel any better, I had no clue, and neither did a number of women I asked about it. Acronyms are widely popular across the Internet, especially on social media and texting apps, because, in some cases, they offer a shorthand for communication that is meant to be instant. READ: Chances are, your teen has sexted, So ”LMK”    let me know    and ”WYCM”    will you call me?    are innocent enough. But the issue, especially for parents, is understanding the slang that could signal some dangerous teen behavior, such as ”GNOC,’” which means ”get naked on camera.” And it certainly helps for a parent to know that ”PIR” means parent in room, which could mean the teen wants to have a conversation about things that his or her mom and dad might not approve of. Katie Greer is a national Internet safety expert who has provided Internet and technology safety training to schools, law enforcement agencies and community organizations throughout the country for more than seven years. She says research shows that a majority of teens believe that their parents are starting to keep tabs on their online and social media lives. ”With that, acronyms can be used by kids to hide certain parts of their conversations from attentive parents,” Greer said. ”Acronyms used for this purpose could potentially raise some red flags for parents.” READ: 10 signs you might be addicted to your smartphone, But parents would drive themselves crazy, she said, if they tried to decode every text, email and post they see their teen sending or receiving. ”I’ve seen some before and it’s like ’The Da Vinci Code,’ where only the kids hold the true meanings (and most of the time they’re fairly innocuous),” she said. Still, if parents come across any acronyms they believe could be problematic, they should talk with their kids about them, said Greer. But how, on earth, is a parent to keep up with all these acronyms, especially since new ones are being introduced every day? ”It’s a lot to keep track of,” Greer said. Parents can always do a Google search if they stumble upon an phrase they aren’t familiar with, but the other option is asking their children, since these phrases can have different meanings for different people.  ”Asking kids not only gives you great information, but it shows that you’re paying attention and sparks the conversation around their online behaviors, which is imperative.” READ: Teen ’like’ and FOMO anxiety  Micky Morrison, a mom of two in Islamorada, Florida, says she finds Internet acronyms ”baffling, annoying and hilarious at the same time.” She’s none too pleased that acronyms like ”LOL” and ”OMG” are being adopted into conversation, and already told her    son    whom she jokingly calls ”deprived,” since he does not have a phone yet    that acronym talk is not allowed in her presence. But the issue really came to a head when her son and his adolescent friends got together and were all ”ignoring one another with noses in their phones,” said Morrison, founder of BabyWeightTV. ”I announced my invention of a new acronym: ’PYFPD.’  Put your freaking phone down.” LOL! But back to the serious issue at hand, below are 28 Internet acronyms, which I learned from Greer and other parents I talked with, as well as from sites such as NoSlang. com and NetLingo. com, and from Cool Mom Tech’s 99 acronyms and phrases that every parent should know. After you read this list, you’ll likely start looking at your teen’s texts in a whole new way. 1.  IWSN   I want sex now, 2.  GNOC   Get naked on camera, 3.  NIFOC   Naked in front of computer, 4.  PIR   Parent in room, 5  CU46   See you for sex, 6.  53X   Sex, 7.  9   Parent watching, 8.  99   Parent gone, 9.  1174’   Party meeting place, 10. THOT   That hoe over there, 11.

Alia Atkinson wins a new world record – and a first for a black woman	2014-12-08	2014	12	A big congratulations to Jamaican swimmer Alia Atkinson, who is a new 100m breaststroke champion. Atkinson completed the race in 1 minute and 2. 36 seconds at the Fina World Swimming championships in Doha at the weekend, equalling the record set by Lithuanian swimmer Rūta Meilutytė. Atkinson is the first ever black woman to win a world swimming title. Atkinson, who mostly trains in Florida, where she also works with the International Swimming Hall of Fame to promote swimming to youngsters from different communities, looked overwhelmed by her win on Saturday. According to a 2010 survey by USA Swimming, 69% of African American children have low or no swimming ability. The stereotype of black people refusing to learn how to swim is a stubborn one to shake, but with Atkinson’s win  —   and others such as Justin Lynch (an    California swimmer who broke Michael Phelps’s 2001 national   record last year)  —   perhaps it is being eroded. After her win, Atkinson told AFP: “Hopefully, my face will come out, there will be more popularity, especially in Jamaica and the Caribbean, and we’ll see more of a rise. ”
Cartel Bosses Run Mexican Empires from Safe Houses in Texas - Breitbart	2014-12-10	2014	12	MCALLEN, Texas  —   The capture of three top Mexican drug cartel bosses on the U. S. side of the Texas border helps to illustrate the irony of how even narco’s seek refuge from the violence in Mexico. [The recent arrest of Jesus Francisco “Comandante Paquito or Comandante 77” Martinez Ramirez marks the third top ranking leader of the Gulf Cartel to be arrested in Texas since October. A similar exodus of drug lords took place  in October 2011 during a period of heavy infighting within the Gulf Cartel when four top commanders fled to Texas illegally to avoid a certain death at the hand of their rivals.  Martinez, who is in the country illegally, remains in federal custody without bond on money laundering charges, court records obtained by Breitbart Texas show.  For his capture agents with the U. S. Drug Enforcement Administration got assistance from the U. S. Marshals Service and the Law Enforcement Emergency Regional Response Team (LEERT) which is a regional tactical team made up of various local police departments. For the arrest, LEERT members arrived in armored vehicles as the approached the house and moved in quickly prepared for a fierce fight.  “We prepare for a firefight and expect resistance from this type of high risk fugitives,” said Juan Gonzalez, the Police Chief of San Juan and the Commander of the LEERT. “Our answer is to overwhelm them with force and coordinate the arrest with local state and federal agencies. We cannot give them an opportunity to use their tactics on this side of the border to get a quick reaction force like they do in Mexico which would allow them to get extracted by their group. ”  The charges stem from a house in the border city of Mission, Texas that was purchased in cash and placed under the name of another woman in order to hide the fact that Martinez is the house owner. The court documents identify Martinez as a high ranking member in the leadership structure of the Gulf Cartel, Martinez was born and raised in one of the poor neighborhood in Reynosa where he joined the ranks of the Gulf Cartel at a young age and in a matter of years climbed his way to neighborhood commander and then to being in charge of Reynosa for the criminal organization, a Tamaulipas law enforcement official who spoke with Breitbart Texas said.  Martinez’s flight to the U. S. is partly due to a hostile takeover of the area by a group of older Gulf Cartel member who have sided with some of the original Zetas and are looking to regain control of the area in order to keep things quiet, the official said.  “The younger guys had been heating up the plaza,” the official said referring to a term used to describe drawing attention to the organization. “They had been kidnapping, extorting and fighting each other. ” As previously reported by Breitbart Texas, just a week before Martinez was caught Orlando Roberto “Comandante Boris” Rodriguez another Gulf Cartel commander turned himself in to authorities in Rio Grande City. A Texas law enforcement official who spoke with Breitbart Texas said Rodriguez was more than cooperative with authorities as he sought refuge from his rivals in Mexico. In October, Breitbart Texas broke the story of the arrest of Gulf Cartel boss Juan “Panochitas” Saenz Tamez who was arrested in Edinburg at a house from where Martinez managed to elude capture.

Critic Roger Ebert appealed to all types of movie fans	2014-12-15	2014	12	 (CNN) There was a time when Roger Ebert was, simply, ”the fat one.”  Explore more about the fascinating world of the late film critic Roger Ebert in the CNN Film ”Life Itself.” When TV viewers first saw Ebert    whether it was on ”Sneak Previews,” his and Gene Siskel’s national PBS movie review show, or ”Siskel  Ebert  the Movies,” the widely syndicated version    they latched on to the look: a slightly rumpled,   guy with glasses, paired off with the much taller, balding Siskel (who, of course, was ”the bald one”). Never mind the Pulitzer Prize for criticism, which Ebert was the first film critic to win. Never mind the probing interviews with figures such as Kirk Douglas and Burt Reynolds. Never mind the expertise he brought to his job or the   attitude he had in offering his critiques.  Most people didn’t see that    until they settled in and watched the two Chicago critics go after each other, debating the finer points of ”Blue Velvet” or ”Die Hard.” It was only then that, perhaps, viewers realized this wasn’t just a show about movies.  Movie quiz: How ’Ebert’ are you? It was also a show about movie reviewing, movie embracing, movieGOING. A shared awe and love of pictures projected in the dark.  And that was Ebert’s genius. (Siskel, who died in 1999, should get some credit, too. The pair’s chemistry was integral to the show’s spirit.)  They reveled in film in ways that appealed to the aficionados    folks who knew who Andrew Sarris and Pauline Kael were    and to the masses,   audiences who didn’t care so much about art as wanting to be entertained for two hours. But well before ”Sneak Previews” and well after Siskel’s death, Ebert reveled in film and shared his enthusiasm with others. In 1967, when he was hired as the Chicago  ’ movie critic, he hadn’t yet turned 25 but sounded like a film veteran.  A generation later, when the Internet came calling, he was all over it, developing his own website, tweeting incessantly, sounding off in one format or another. He made his site a home for young movie enthusiasts and ran reviews from ”  correspondents.”  He invited comments and, perhaps surprisingly, rarely had to deal with trolls. By loving conversation, he made sure the dialogue was always respectful. Trolls and fanboys went elsewhere to vent. It’s not that he wasn’t opinionated. His arguments with Siskel    and later with Richard Roeper    testify to that. One of his books was titled ”I Hated, Hated, Hated This Movie.” Another was ”Your Movie Sucks.”  But even the emotion was less about anger than disappointment, a sense of ”how dare you.” He knew how hard it was to make a movie after all, he’d written the script for a couple, including ”Beyond the Valley of the Dolls,” and went out of his way to praise small performances and   filmmakers. A film that didn’t try was more than a waste of time. It was an offense. ”(I) hated the implied insult to the audience by its belief that anyone would be entertained by it,” he wrote about ”North.”  ”I’ve seen bad movies before. But they usually made me care about how bad they were,” he wrote about a film called ”Mad Dog Time.” Not even cancer, which forced the removal of his lower jaw and eventually took his life, could tamp down his energy.  As he watches a movie, ”Ebert scribbles constantly, his pen digging into page after page, and then he tears the pages out of his notebook and drops them to the floor around him. Maybe 20 or 30 times, the sound of paper being torn from a spiral rises from the aisle seat in the last row,” Chris Jones wrote in a 2010 Esquire profile. ”The lights come back on. Ebert stays in his chair, savoring, surrounded by his notes. It looks as though he’s sitting on top of a cloud of paper.” Watching movies has been compared to waking dreams: the darkness, the colors, the sense of being immersed in another world. More than once, Ebert wrote about the experience of seeing films as a reverie and escape. Few were better at conveying that sense to those outside the theater. And that cloud? One can see him there, a man among the mist, lost in the light.
Sports stadium architecture: Welcome to the new temples of pleasure	2014-12-15	2014	12	 (CNN) It’s a vision of biblical proportions    tens of thousands of people weeping, whooping, and chanting in unison. If sport were a religion, then the stadium would surely be its place of worship.  Inside these temples to physical feats, language evokes the divine    fearful fans ”pray for a miracle,” while losing prompts serious ” .”  So much so that architects these days must create more than a stage for human endurance. It’s as if they have been asked to perform the architectural equivalent of feeding the 5, 000 with five loaves and two fish    constructing an arena to elevate the senses, capture the spirit of a community, and become an icon for a city long after the last fan has passed through the turnstiles. ”It’s like creating a contemporary cathedral in some ways,” said Spela Videcnik, architect behind the   ”spotty” Borisov Arena, home to the Belarus national football team. ”Often the stadium is meant to become the pride of a city, a landmark object, and as such, a monument representing the latest achievements in architecture.” Since ancient Greeks built the first Olympic stadium in fine white marble, the arena has been as much about inspiring awe, as staging competition.  Today’s architects must go even further. Return to Roman times? In an age where sporting events are captured on television in brilliant detail, designers must lure us from the comfort of living rooms with multipurpose entertainment centers. No longer relegated to the outskirts of town, these   social hubs are creeping inside our metropolises once more    and they have more in common with historic cathedrals than you might think. ”Look at the ancient Greek and Roman stadiums    they’re very much in the middle of the city,” said Hubert Nienhoff, veteran German architect behind the redeveloped Berlin Olympic Stadium, and Amazon Arena at this year’s World Cup in Brazil. ”But in the last 50 years, the stadium became something that was not really integrated, they were built outside the cities. They were for people who went there perhaps once a week for an event.” While arenas like the Colosseum in the heart of Rome occupy real estate today’s architects could only dream of, we may soon see a return to centralized social spaces of old, says Nienhoff. ”Now we’re bringing in multiple uses for stadiums again, like shops and conference halls,” he said. ”In the future they will not be outside the city but, something like the cathedrals of the Middle Ages, they will be a vital part of city life.”  A key part of this vision, however, will depend on improved transport infrastructure. ”There was a trend back in the 1980s of treating stadiums a bit like shopping centers. So you’d try and put them on the edges of cities,” said architect Clive Lewis, designer behind the Singapore National Stadium and Sports Hub, and winner at this year’s World Architecture Festival award. ”But more and more it’s important to make a stadium that’s part of the city. They need to be integrated into the transport infrastructure, so they’re a naturally connected part of the city    the event should start as soon as you leave your house.” He goes one step further with a vision of one roof to house all of humanity. ”For me, stadiums have taken over the function of a cathedral. It’s a building that brings together people of all ages, all cultures, all religions. ”And the only other thing that comes close to that is an airport.” Lasting legacy, At the heart of an arena, both physically and spiritually, is its playing area. And with the outcome of multimillion dollar matches riding on everything from grass quality, to the position of the sun, designers must get it pitch perfect. Does that mean architects need to be sports fans themselves?  ”Do we need to be religious to build a church? We don’t think so,” comes the reply from Berger Architects, the company behind the brilliantly illuminated Luanda Multisports Pavilion in Angola. ”Architects must be able to project themselves, and think as if they were the final users of the space they’re designing.” And long after the grand final trophies have been handed out, an arena must serve its people for decades to come. ”Whether we’re designing for the Olympics or the World Cup, we’re always actually thinking ahead to what we’re going to do with the venue after that event,” said Lewis, whose Singapore Sports Hub hopes to hold 200 events every year. ”And I think there’s a history in recent years of relatively few examples that have done that very well.” Perhaps the most striking example of this failure is Athens.  The Greek capital may be the home of the modern Olympics, but over a century later, its 2004 stadia has become a modern ruin of its own, with venues overgrown with weeds, walls covered in graffiti, and seating rotted away.  It’s an   death for an event which cost the country around $11 billion to host. Entertainment plus, Step inside today’s stadiums, and you’ll find an entertainment juggernaut where fans are encouraged to dig deep into their pockets long before the first  . ”Over the last 50 years corporate interests have changed stadiums more than anything else. Years ago, stadiums were just bare concrete and no seats, just bleachers,” said Lewis. ”Today, it’s a lot more about the corporate experience    the internal lounge, corporate boxes, restaurants. Which means that people are coming to the venue an hour or two before the event and not leaving for an hour or two afterwards.” The goal for stadium owners is to create an icon for the city    one worthy of their name stamped across it in bright lights. ”The mayor asked us for something that would ’put Durban on the map,’” says Nienhoff of the Moses Mabhiba Stadium, in Durban, built for the 2010 South African World Cup. ”If you looked at Durban from the waterside, there was nothing you could remember specifically from the skyline.” That was before Neinhoff’s stark white arena was built on the coastline, its swooping 350 meter arched entrance and ruffled roof a sight to behold. Natural instinct, But before Nienhoff even puts pen to paper, one of the first places he looks for inspiration is nature. With its reptilian façade, the Amazon Arena, built in Manaus for the World up in Brazil this year, borrows much from the surrounding jungle. ”If you look into the structures of nature like a leaf, or the skin of a snake, there’s always a logical system behind it,” explained Nienhoff. ”Manaus is in the middle of a rainforest, so that’s where we turned for inspiration. We’re really trying to design something that’s only meant for this one place.” Like nature itself, these modern day temples of pleasure will also need to regenerate themselves, in order to survive.

People who feel younger at heart live longer	2014-12-17	2014	12	 (CNN) Go ahead lie about your age. It may be the very thing that helps you live a longer life. If those fibbers truly believe that they are younger than what it says on their birth certificate, a new study shows they are among a group of people who have a lower death rate. That’s compared with those who felt their age or who even feel older than their years. The land of the elders, The new research letter is published in JAMA Internal Medicine online.  The study looked at data from from 6, 489 people with an average age of 65. 8 years who reported that they felt a little less than 10 years younger.  What’s interesting is most people in the study didn’t feel like their actual age. Most said they felt about three years younger. Only a tiny percent, some 4. 8% felt at least a year older than their actual age. When University College London researchers followed up on these people over the next eight years, the scientists found only a little over 14% of those who felt younger than their years had died. That was compared with the more than 24% of the people who reported feeling older or feeling their age who had died. Some 18% of the people who felt like their chronological age died in that same time period.  Why happiness is healthy, The researchers say they want to better understand what made the difference with this group. ”Possibilities include a broader set of health behaviors than we measured (such as maintaining a healthy weight and adherence to medical advice) and greater resilience, sense of mastery and will to live among those who feel younger than their age,” the study concludes. ”  age has the potential to change, so interventions may be possible. Individuals who feel older than their actual age could be targeted with health messages promoting positive health behaviors and attitudes toward aging.” Dr. Sharon Bergquist, a physician and assistant professor of medicine at Emory University School of Medicine who specializes in healthy aging, isn’t surprised by the results. ”Research is showing us that personality can so be tied to your destiny,” Bergquist said. Your happiness type matters, New research into the link between personality and aging finds that there are two main traits that seem to help people live a longer life: conscientiousness and optimism.  People who have both traits may have more of a will to do the right thing to live a healthy lifestyle that can keep them healthy long into old age.   ”Aging well can certainly become a   prophecy,” she said. 
The U.S. And Cuba: A Brief History Of A Complicated Relationship	2014-12-17	2014	12	Editor’s Note: This story was originally published in December 2014 when President Obama announced plans to improve U. S. ties with Cuba. We’re republishing it with minor updates following Fidel Castro’s death.  Just months after he seized power in Cuba, Fidel Castro visited Washington in April 1959 and received a warm welcome. Castro met Vice President Richard Nixon, placed a wreath at the base of both the Lincoln and Jefferson memorials and was photographed looking up in seeming admiration of both U. S. presidents. For U. S.  relations, it was almost all downhill for the next  . The standoff outlasted 10 U. S. presidents, a failed invasion, a nuclear crisis and countless boatloads of Cuban asylum seekers. Meanwhile, the Castros kept running Cuba uninterrupted. President Obama, the 11th president to deal with the Castros, said in December 2014 it was time for a change. ”We cannot keep doing the same thing and expect a different result,” the president said as he announced plans to normalize relations, including embassies in both capitals. The U. S. Embargo, With Fidel Castro’s rise, attempts to establish normal relations soon gave way to mutual recriminations. The young Cuban leader denounced ”Yankee imperialism” and developed ties with the Soviet Union. President Eisenhower placed an economic embargo on Cuba in October 1960, and diplomatic relations were severed the following year. The Cold War moves were intended to contain, if not roll back, communism, but those measures would soon be overtaken by far more dramatic events. The U. S.  Bay of Pigs invasion, a 1961 disaster carried out by Cuban exiles, was just one of at least eight futile U. S. attempts to oust Fidel Castro in the 1960s. The Bay of Pigs was followed a year later by the Cuban missile crisis, a U. S.  staredown that ended with Moscow removing its missiles from the island. Lesser crises came and went in the years that followed, but the embargo endured. It has succeeded in keeping Cuba poor and isolated but has also served as a badge of defiance for the Castros, who have blamed their own shortcomings on the U. S. policy. Despite the embargo, the Castro regime has never been seriously threatened from inside Cuba and over time the U. S. policy developed its own contradictions. The older generation of   who fled during the early years of Fidel Castro’s authoritarian regime has been the strongest proponent of maintaining the tough embargo. Yet over time, growing numbers of this generation have conceded that the policy was not working.   have also been the most frequent visitors to Cuba, often delivering assistance to relatives on the island and thus helping ordinary Cubans cope with economic hardships. Meanwhile, a younger generation of   born in the U. S. has shown far less interest in waging the battle launched by their parents. For Decades, Few Changes, Prior to Obama’s policy change, alterations to the status quo were marked by limited steps. Under President Carter, the countries opened interests sections in each other’s capitals. Carter also said those wishing to leave Cuba would be welcome in the U. S. Some 125, 000 Cubans set off from the island, most all in small boats in the   Mariel boatlift. The new arrivals included many thousands that Castro cut loose from the country’s prisons and mental institutions. Many Americans felt Castro pulled a fast one on the U. S. and the embargo was tightened with a series of measures in the 1980s and ’90s. The pendulum swung the other way in 1999, when President Clinton eased travel restrictions and encouraged increased cultural exchanges. Under President George W. Bush, U. S. relations with Havana deteriorated as the president declared: ”We’re not waiting for the day of Cuban freedom we are working for the day of freedom in Cuba.” However, the U. S. embargo faced increasing criticism from the international community, particularly in Latin America, where many countries felt that Washington’s isolation of Cuba increasingly proved counterproductive. There were hints that the U. S. policy might change, but little concrete action, after Raul Castro assumed the presidential duties from his ailing brother in 2006 and Obama expressed his preference for increased ties. Raul Castro has taken some steps to allow   private businesses, though the reforms have moved slowly. Obama shook hands with Raul Castro at a memorial service in South Africa following the 2013 death of Nelson Mandela. It was described as only the second handshake between leaders of the two countries in the past   and observers tried to divine whether it held any meaning for the future of U. S.  relations. ”Mandela showed us the power of action,” Obama said in his speech, ”of taking risks on behalf of our ideals.” A year later, Obama began to normalize the U. S.  ties, and followed that up with a visit to Cuba in March of this year, becoming the first sitting U. S. president to go to the island in 88 years. The two countries are still trying to define the new relationship. But after Fidel Castro died on Friday night, Obama offered hopeful words on Saturday morning: ”For nearly six decades, the relationship between the United States and Cuba was marked by discord and profound political disagreements,” Obama said. ”During my presidency, we have worked hard to put the past behind us, pursuing a future in which the relationship between our two countries is defined not by our differences but by the many things that we share as neighbors and friends.” Greg Myre is the international editor of NPR. org.

’Foxcatcher’: The crazy du Pont next door	2014-12-19	2014	12	 (CNN) He was the local loon. We didn’t call him that, of course. He had buckets of money, and he was our neighbor, so we were polite. He was simply ”odd.”   He bought a replica police car, put on a uniform, flashed his auxiliary badge and made traffic stops outside the gates of his estate. He wrote   citations and warnings, scolding everyone that they were driving too fast.  He let my swim team train during the winter in his   indoor pool. If you had an AAU ranking, you were invited to wear blue and gold   and   emblazoned with ”Foxcatcher,” the title he’d give his estate.  John E. du Pont was his name. He was a direct descendant of E. I. du Pont, who founded a gunpowder mill that grew into the huge chemical company that gave the world nylon and Teflon. His father was known as ”Stinky Willie” because of his aversion to personal grooming. John du Pont was awkward and pedantic, the eccentric millionaire next door. He collected seashells and stuffed birds and referred to himself as ”America’s golden eagle.” He called his more prominent relatives ”the lesser du Ponts,” but the title probably fit him better. He was worth as much as $200 million, according to one Forbes estimate, and spent lavishly on his passion: amateur freestyle wrestling. He gave more than $3 million to the sport’s governing body, USA Wrestling.  Then he shot and killed one of wrestling’s Olympic stars on the grounds of his estate. He was convicted and sent to prison, where he died four years ago. Said the man who won a murder conviction against du Pont: ”He was just a crackpot, a real crackpot.”  From real life to the silver screen, Now actor Steve Carell has brought the crackpot back to life. There’s Oscar buzz already for ”Foxcatcher.” And while wrestling movies aren’t my thing, I simply had to go see the    Virgin play the Boo Radley of my childhood.  Carell, a ”Daily Show” alum beloved for playing Michael Scott in the popular sitcom ”The Office,” deserves every bit of the   praise he’s getting. He could very well follow Nicole Kidman on the path to Oscar glory    a journey that seems to require wearing a prosthetic nose and playing someone awful and tragic.  ”Foxcatcher” is a dark movie, and Carell captures this entitled, homicidal nut so well that I completely forgot I was watching a guy who plays it for laughs in Judd Apatow comedies. The movie is based on the story told by Mark Schultz, the brother of the man du Pont killed in 1996. David Schultz, an Olympic   winner, trained and coached at the athletic compound du Pont built on his sprawling estate in my hometown.  Mark Schultz, an intense pit bull of a man, also wrestled and trained with du Pont. He has a book out, also called ”Foxcatcher,” and he’s an executive producer of the movie. Both book and movie frankly depict the compromises athletes made to maintain the support of a wealthy but unhinged and controlling benefactor.  My family was hardly rich, but we lived in a nice neighborhood called Echo Valley, which was built in the 1960s next to the du Pont estate in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania. John and his mother, Jean Liseter Austin du Pont, were always the talk of the township. John’s mother raised show beagles and Welsh ponies that dominated the competitions at the annual Devon Horse Show for more than half a century. She was a member of the Radnor Hunt Club. She loved chasing foxes with her society friends. That meant dogs, horses and wealthy people in red coats and high black boots could come tearing across the back yard as you polished off a bowl of Cheerios on Saturday mornings. The du Ponts’ relationship with the neighbors certainly wasn’t a   street. Their   property was posted with ”No Trespassing” signs. As kids, we squirmed under the barbed wire fence to hunt for leopard frogs in the estate’s many ponds. Lucky for us, this was a few years before he started patrolling the grounds in a tank.  Later I learned why the place was off limits. The kidnapping of San Francisco heiress Patty Hearst apparently terrified the du Ponts. This fear eventually grew into   paranoia. Dreams of athletic glory, John trained as a swimmer for a while with the famed Santa Clara Swim Club in northern California, but he was probably the slowest guy in the pool. He had his own   pool built on the estate in the late 1960s, but it was painfully obvious that he’d never set any records, no matter how hard he trained.  So he tried his hand at the pentathlon, which adds fencing, show jumping, pistol shooting and a   run to the swim. This made him a bit of a local hero. He’s training for the Olympics, the neighbors would boast. But the truth was, no matter how much time or money he spent training, he was never going to be good enough to make the Olympic team.  I had an opportunity to interview du Pont by telephone long ago for The County Leader, Newtown Square’s weekly newspaper. It was my first reporting job out of college. He had used his helicopter to airlift a woman in labor to a hospital during a snowstorm. He was charming enough and clearly loved the attention.  But he was far from a socialite. He said during a magazine interview that he avoided social occasions, fearing all those   mothers intent on foisting their daughters on him.  He met the woman who would become his wife at a hospital after injuring his hand. She was not of his class, but he walked down the aisle, the neighbors gossiped, because taking a wife was a condition of his inheritance.  The marriage lasted less than a year she left him, saying in a lawsuit that he drank heavily, pushed her into a fireplace, pointed a gun at her head and called her a Russian spy. She asked for $5 million, but the case was settled and the terms never disclosed.  When I was a kid, the du Pont estate was still known as Liseter Hall Farms, the name John’s mother had given it. It had been part of William Penn’s original charter for Newtown Township and was a wedding gift from her father.  She held onto the place after her husband, Stinky Willie, departed in 1940. The   mansion was a replica of President James Madison’s Montpelier, a Virginia estate that was occupied for a time by some of those   ”lesser du Ponts.” She painted the house and outbuildings white and the shutters green. She never remarried and raised her youngest son alone, alongside her prized beagles and ponies. The   creatures seemed more skilled at pleasing her by winning medals and ribbons than the boy did.  His mother looked down on wrestling, saying it was the sport of ”ruffians.” And I don’t think John was particularly fond of the dogs and ponies that commanded her attention. In one scene in the movie, he chases the horses from the barn after his mother dies. Burned into my memory  That scene reminded me why the sight of that barn always scared me. It burned to the ground when I was about 8. I was watching my favorite show, ”Batman,” on the big, new color TV in the family room when an eerie, orange glow lit up the night sky. For days afterward, Echo Valley smelled like steak night at summer camp. Some 30 horses perished in the fire. It was terrifying to pass the barn’s   hulk on the school bus. I’d cry at the thought of all those charred ponies and thoroughbreds. The neighborhood gossip mill had a field day when John bought the replica police car and started writing warnings. Officer John, we called him. He seemed to particularly enjoy stopping a neighbor who drove a sporty red Alfa Romeo convertible.  Du Pont let local police departments use his shooting range for weapons training. Officers rented houses on the estate on the cheap. He played the role of eccentric benefactor perfectly.  He had enough money and enough land to insulate his mental illness until it exploded in violence.  The 1988 death of his mother was a turning point in John’s life. He changed the name of the estate to Foxcatcher Farm. And he really started going off the rails.  The movie dishes up plenty of crazy.   Pont drives a tank, flies a helicopter, shoots off guns and cannons, has postage stamps made in his likeness, crashes a couple of Lincoln town cars into the frog pond, drinks like a fish, calls himself the Dalai Lama and gets grabby with the wrestlers.  He claimed ghosts lived in the walls of his mansion and rigged them with razor wire. He saw bugs crawling in the patterns on the Oriental rugs and felt them under his skin. He grew increasingly paranoid and menacing.  His final descent, Du Pont’s entry into the annals of true crime came on January 26, 1996. His silver Lincoln slowly cruised up Dave Schultz’s driveway on the DuPont compound. John rolled down the window and asked, ”You got a problem with me?” He fired a .  Magnum revolver twice. Schultz’s wife, Nancy, stepped onto the porch as du Pont fired a third shot into the dying man’s back as he lay sprawled on the ground.  The shooter retreated to his mansion, where for two days he held off 75 cops, including 30 SWAT team members, many of whom had practiced on his firing range. Neighbors gathered at the gate and traded ”Officer John” stories as police shined bright lights on the mansion and shut off the utilities.  Du Pont was arrested when he emerged from his mansion to check on a boiler in the gatehouse.  There were strong suggestions in the movie that du Pont’s interest in his wrestlers might have been more than that of a mentor. The movie played it with a heavy hand. Back in the real world, there were troubling allegations at the courthouse.  A wrestling coach at Villanova University, which du Pont also lavished with his millions, sued for wrongful termination. He claimed he was fired after spurning du Pont’s advances. Villanova eventually discontinued the wrestling program. And, after du Pont was arrested on the murder charge, Villanova took his name off its sports pavilion.  Wrestlers were quoted in court depositions describing duPont’s custom grappling move. Called ”the Foxcatcher Five,” it involved grabbing an opponent at his most vulnerable spot    between the legs.  In his book, Mark Schultz says he believes du Pont faked insanity during his murder trial. He cited a single anecdote that left him feeling a little sorry for his brother’s killer: He said Du Pont confided in him about a riding accident he had when he was a boy. John was caught on a fence, and his injured testicles became infected. They were removed and replaced with prosthetics.  Du Pont was probably the richest man in the United States to stand trial for murder, says   Dennis McAndrews. He worked on the case with prosecutor Joseph McGettigan, who later sent former Penn State assistant football coach and serial child molester Jerry Sandusky to prison.  I covered Sandusky’s trial in 2012, and ran into McAndrews. I had covered some of his cases as a cub reporter and there he was, advising McGettigan from the peanut gallery. The two now practice law together on Philadelphia’s Main Line.  Du Pont went on trial a year or two after O. J. Simpson’s wealth funded a legal dream team that won his acquittal in the murders of his   Nicole, and waiter Ron Goldman.  Du Pont’s prosecutors anticipated another dream team defense designed to convince the jury that he was legally insane. So they portrayed him the way they saw him, as ”a   entitled rich guy,” as McAndrews put it.  Asked his view of du Pont, McGettigan did not mince words. Du Pont wasn’t crazy he was a jerk.  ”Some people are just basically jerks,” he says. ”Whether he was born a jerk or was made a jerk, he was a jerk. He was a mean guy. Money was inconsequential to him. When you have years and years of enabling by scores of people because of your incredible wealth, it can veer into tragic circumstances.”  Experts testified that du Pont was a paranoid schizophrenic. The defense made liberal use of brain scans, considered at the time to be a huge technical and evidentiary advance. Prosecutors didn’t deny he had issues but argued that they didn’t meet the legal standard for insanity. By holing up in his mansion for two days, du Pont was acknowledging that he knew what he did was wrong, they argued.  During his trial, du Pont wore blue and gold Team Foxcatcher   to court. He had done all the crazy things people talked about, but there usually was some grain of truth or ironic twist of logic behind it, McAndrews said.  Yes, du Pont hired people to scour the estate for tunnels, but tunnels really did run under the mansion. Yes, he installed razor wire between the mansion walls, McAndrews said, but the wrestlers used to hide in those walls and jump out and startle du Pont. The jury decided that du Pont was mentally ill but guilty of   murder. They were convinced he acted with malice when he shot Schultz but did not plan in advance to kill him.  As Judge Patricia Jenkins put it: He was mad, and he was bad.  End of the journey: prison, Du Pont was sentenced to 13 to 30 years in prison, where he died in December 2010 at the age of 72.  He spent what should have been his golden years behind bars.   While he was locked up, du Pont ordered the sign at the estate’s gate changed to read, ”Foxcatcher Prison Farm.” On his orders, employees painted the buildings black, including the crime scene, a stone house along Goshen Road. Was he was trying to erase everything that happened there? Or was he signaling that he, too, was in mourning?  People in my old neighborhood had hoped the du Pont place would be maintained as public open space. But it became an eyesore as the weeds sprouted, the horses roamed and the stately Georgian mansion started to fade after standing empty for more than a decade. It sold shortly before du Pont’s death for $28. 5 million.  About 125 acres already had gone to Episcopal Academy, a prestigious Main Line prep school that built a new campus there in 2008. A few more acres were turned into a park. And the rest is being developed.   It would have cost too much to restore the mansion to its former glory. So, the Montpelier replica was torn down to make room for upscale suburban houses that sell for upwards of $2 million apiece. John du Pont is buried at an undisclosed location. Under the terms of his will, he was laid to rest in his Foxcatcher wrestling singlet. 
NORAD’s Santa Tracker Began With A Typo And A Good Sport	2014-12-19	2014	12	This Christmas Eve people all over the world will log on to the official Santa Tracker to follow his progress through U. S. military radar. This all started in 1955, with a misprint in a Colorado Springs newspaper and a call to Col. Harry Shoup’s secret hotline at the Continental Air Defense Command, now known as NORAD. Shoup’s children, Terri Van Keuren, 65, Rick Shoup, 59, and Pam Farrell, 70, recently visited StoryCorps to talk about how the tradition began. Terri remembers her dad had two phones on his desk, including a red one. ”Only a   general at the Pentagon and my dad had the number,” she says. ”This was the ’50s, this was the Cold War, and he would have been the first one to know if there was an attack on the United States,” Rick says. The red phone rang one day in December 1955, and Shoup answered it, Pam says. ”And then there was a small voice that just asked, ’Is this Santa Claus?’ ” His children remember Shoup as   and disciplined, and he was annoyed and upset by the call and thought it was a joke  —   but then, Terri says, the little voice started crying. ”And Dad realized that it wasn’t a joke,” her sister says. ”So he talked to him,   ’d and asked if he had been a good boy and, ’May I talk to your mother?’ And the mother got on and said, ’You haven’t seen the paper yet? There’s a phone number to call Santa. It’s in the Sears ad.’ Dad looked it up, and there it was, his red phone number. And they had children calling one after another, so he put a couple of airmen on the phones to act like Santa Claus.” ”It got to be a big joke at the command center. You know, ’The old man’s really flipped his lid this time. We’re answering Santa calls,’ ” Terri says. ”The airmen had this big glass board with the United States on it and Canada, and when airplanes would come in they would track them,” Pam says. ”And Christmas Eve of 1955, when Dad walked in, there was a drawing of a sleigh with eight reindeer coming over the North Pole,” Rick says. ”Dad said, ’What is that?’ They say, ’Colonel, we’re sorry. We were just making a joke. Do you want us to take that down?’ Dad looked at it for a while, and next thing you know, Dad had called the radio station and had said, ’This is the commander at the Combat Alert Center, and we have an unidentified flying object. Why, it looks like a sleigh.’ Well, the radio stations would call him like every hour and say, ’Where’s Santa now?’ ” Terri says. ”And later in life he got letters from all over the world, people saying, ’Thank you, Colonel,’ for having, you know, this sense of humor. And in his 90s, he would carry those letters around with him in a briefcase that had a lock on it like it was   information,” she says. ”You know, he was an important guy, but this is the thing he’s known for.” ”Yeah,” Rick says, ”it’s probably the thing he was proudest of, too.” Produced for Morning Edition by Jasmyn Belcher Morris.

Ernesto de la Fé and the Trial of Fidel Castro	2014-12-20	2014	12	Editor’s Note: In the June 6, 1959, issue of National Review, John Leonard profiled the early Castro government’s arrest of Ernesto de la Fé, a Cuban journalist and   minister of information under the Batista regime. (He later resigned in protest against that government’s corruption and cruelty.) De la Fé’s principled   views led to his being arrested by the revolutionary government under direct orders from Che Guevara. Castro denounced him as the “Goebbels of Cuba,” an ironic remark given that de la Fé had once provided a young Fidel refuge as he was fleeing assassination attempts. He remained a political prisoner in Cuba until 1981, and after his release traveled throughout the United States to speak about the evils of Communism. While the Castro government would not officially become Communist for several years, de la Fé’s arrest and Leonard’s profile clearly show that the leftist totalitarian barbarism that would become a hallmark of the regime was in place from the outset. I did not see de la Fé, assurances notwithstanding. I was shunted from office to office, entwined in red tape of application forms and letters of explanation, accused of representing a “reactionary,   magazine,” and asked to remain in my hotel room. I did have ample opportunity to talk with a number of Cuban journalists, businessmen, lawyers, members of the government, university students, and ordinary citizens. Most of them were eager to talk to me, although most of them requested that their names be withheld. It is from their testimony that this story has been pieced together, and it will be their goodwill and concern that rescues Cuba  —   if it can be rescued  —   from the tide of Communist infiltration. I. THE MAN, Ernesto de la Fé is a short, dark, balding man in his late forties one of five brothers married, with two children a journalist acknowledged throughout Latin America to be honest and compassionate and incorruptibly  . This week Ernesto de la Fé enters his sixth month in Havana’s La Cabaña prison  —   a dilapidated fortress at the ocean end of the   recently converted by Fidel Castro’s provisional government into a political prison which holds 1, 000 unarraigned, untried prisoners incommunicado, most of whom sleep by necessity at night on the prison floor. De la Fé has not been formally accused of any crime. He has not seen his lawyer, his wife, his brothers, or any of his friends since his arrest on January 4, 1959, three days after Batista fled into exile. He does not know that his wife gave birth to a daughter two months ago. Letters and telegrams to him at La Cabana are either diverted or destroyed. Political Mistakes, Ernesto de la Fé is singularly important in La Cabaña because of the esteem in which his colleagues hold him, all over Latin America, because of the rancor of his enemies, and because of the circumstances surrounding his arrest and imprisonment. Fidel Castro’s press secretary has charac terized him as “a Fascist, a traitor, and a skunk” Castro himself has called him the “Goebbels of Cuba. ” And then he has been saluted by Mexico City’s El Universal as a “courageous journalist persecuted for the truth of what he says. ” His plight has elicited hundreds of protests from newspapermen all over the hemisphere. Last week in Havana most Cuban journalists were predicting he would be shot. Ernesto de la Fé has made political mistakes. He welcomed Fulgencio Batista’s coup d’état of March 10, 1952. Along with others, including members of the U. S. Embassy in Havana, he believed that Batista would improve upon the impotent, corrupt, and disintegrating regime of Carlos Prío. Shortly after Batista’s bloodless revolution, de la Fé was appointed Minister of Information. He served in the Batista cabinet for two years, identified primarily for the creation of El Movimiento de Integración Democrática Americana, an agency designed to combat Communist infiltration in the govemment and his support of a new law protecting the interests of Cuban journalists. The law is still on the statute books  —   even though Castro’s government rules by decree. These two acts comprise the substance of de la Fé’s official political career. He was never charged with an act of terrorism, of brutality, or corruption. In September 1954, de la Fé resigned from the Batista cabinet with a violent denunciation of government corruption and cruelty. He charged Batista with a plan for   the following November, with   illegal tax rebates, and broken promises to the Cuban people. In an article published in Bohemia magazine, a   monthly, he lambasted Batista for a secret deal with Cuba’s Communists, a mutual “ ” agreement which permitted known Communist leaders to operate within the law  —   so long as they did not obstruct the Batista government. For two years Ernesto de la Fé campaigned in the public press for government reform. His exposés of Batista atrocities and his reports on Communist infiltration of the Sierra Maestra revolutionary army provided the best and most exciting journalism of an otherwise arid period in Cuban newspaper history. In January 1956, he wrote and published an article accusing Batista of a plot to murder his political opponents, among them Carlos Prío (busy supplying arms and advice to Castro) Dr. Pelayo Cuervo Navarro, and Dr. Rafael Garcia Bárcenas. Two days after publication of the article, Pelayo Cuervo was found mysteriously dead. Carloads of armed men circled the house of de la Fé’s mother, where he often stayed, and for several days and nights cruised about the neighborhood waiting for him to appear. He went into hiding until administrative wrath subsided. In the February 15, 1956, issue of Bohemia, de la Fé told the story of those days of hiding, and of the armed men dispatched to intimidate him. That was the end of his journalistic career in Cuba. Batista forbade Bohemia ever to publish him again, and ordered every other Cuban newspaper and magazine to blacklist him. To enforce that order he commissioned Rolando Masferrer, the same Havana heavy of the Anastasia style who had chased Castro in 1948, to make regular rounds of the newspaper offices to drive the point home. From the winter of 1956 until Batista’s defeat by the revolutionary army, Ernesto de la Fé could find no publisher in his native Cuba. His articles continued to appear, however, in other countries, notably in El Universal, the staid but vigorous Mexico City daily. He did more than write. An active member of Cuba’s National Association of Journalists, he protested bitterly when it nominated Batista as its honorary Member Number One. He devoted his energies to the Confederación   de Defensa del Continente (  Federation for the Defense of the Continent)  —   an organization of   journalists and labor leaders united to fight Communist infiltration and influence in their respective countries. He was elected   of the organization in 1957. He headed the Cuban delegation to the Third Congress Against Soviet Intervention, April 10 —  14, 1957, in Lima. He served as a symbol “to Latin America of intelligent, effective   and incorruptible dedication to truth,” to use the words of Jorge Prieto Laurens, Mexican journalist and Vice President of the Federation for the Defense of the Continent. This is the background of the man arrested and dragged into prison by a revolutionary movement which proclaims freedom of press and individual, and which triumphed in Cuba largely by convincing the people that it had as its aim the restoration of the dignity and human rights Batista had degraded, dismissed, and abused. Why? Three separate Cuban journalists, all pleading that their names be withheld, told me in Havana last week: “Because de la Fé is an  . ” Ernesto de la Fé was arrested prior to Castro’s triumphal entry into Havana. Three men (Captains Fidel Domenech, Moisés Pérez, and Luís Fajardo Escalona  —   all members of the Cuban Communist party) broke into de la Fé’s office, ransacked his files, and destroyed everything they did not confiscate. They then burned his office, which served as Cuban headquarters for the Federation for the Defense of the Continent and the OIPAC (  Organization of   Journalists) to the ground, and marched off with their prisoner. They took with them data on Communist activities in Latin America, membership lists of local Communist organizations both overt and covert, and general information reports and financial estimates dealing with the Communist movement. Che Guevara  Why was the office ransacked and destroyed? The three Communist soldiers acted under direct orders of Ernesto Che Guevara  —   Comandante in Castro’s army, presently in charge of La Cabaña prison and Revolutionary Director of Personnel, and one of Latin America’s key Communists. Che Guevara controls a third of the Cuban army, commands the loyalty of two Havana daily newspapers, operates a Cuban Cominform and three Marxist schools, and is in charge of military trials and executions. He is the only important figure in Castro’s government conceded to be a Communist by Jules DuBois, Chicago Tribune   correspondent and author of the recent bestselling whitewash of the revolution. Guevara left his native Argentina to bolster the   Arbenz regime in Guatemala, and was expelled in 1955 after Castillo Armas’s successful revolution. From Guatemala he went to Mexico to handle the public relations of the Institute of   Culture. He is the principal liaison between the Cuban Communist Party, its agents in the Castro government, and the labor unions, and the Soviet international Comintern. He is a professional revolutionary agent, a veteran of Communist activities in Panama, the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, and a host of other South American nations. It is he who ordered Ernesto de la Fé arrested, who presides over La Cabaña where de la Fé is imprisoned, and who will officiate at de la Fé’s trial. Spokesmen for the Castro government told me that the predicted charges against de la Fé are two: first (treason) that he had been a minister in Batista’s cabinet  —   sufficient, they said, to assure his execution second, that he had plotted to assassinate Prime Minister Castro  —   after he had been thrown into La Cabaña. The second charge can be dismissed as ludicrous. A man cut off from the outside world, under tacit sentence of death, unable to see even his own lawyer or wife, let alone interview political assassins, is scarcely in a position to engineer an assassination attempt. As for the first charge: it ignores de la Fé’s public repudiation of Bastista, his courageous campaign against the dictator, and the persecution he suffered as a result of that campaign over a period of two years. Has everyone who was ever a minister under Batista been given such treatment? No. Some   were permitted to flee into exile. Some were sentenced to ritual penances, and quietly released. And some, e. g. Raul Lorenzo (former Minister of Commerce) and Miguel Suárez Fernández (former Minister without Portfolio) walk the streets of Havana today as free men. What is it about de la Feé? He is being punished, everyone in Havana seems to agree exclusively for his   activities. II. THE DEFENSE, Ernesto de la Fé’s defense will be conducted by a lawyer who is also a member of Castro’s government, working for the Ministry of the Interior. He accepted the case only because he is a personal friend of the defendant, and will conduct it on strictly professional grounds. The Communist issue will not figure in the trial. He refused to let me use his name, or to discuss the question in the   context. He has been informed that he will be permitted to see de la Fé, for the first time, 24 hours before the trial. The date of the trial, often postponed, has been set for this week. Despite Fidel Castro’s edict ordering civil trials for civilian prisoners, de la Fé will receive a military trial under the unsympathetic auspices of Che Guevara. Neither lawyer nor client has been told what witnesses will be called for the prosecution, nor will there be a confrontation between witnesses and the accused. The reluctance on the part of de la Fé’s friends and fellow journalists to speak out in his behalf is understandable for those who have done so have been dealt with severely. On January 6, two days after de la Fé’s arrest, Raúl Granja, a Cuban journalist who had worked actively for the revolution, protested to the new government the treatment of his friend. Granja, who had just returned from an American jumket to gather arms and materiel for Castro, was promptly clapped into jail  —   and kept there for 41 days before his friends la the government succeeded in prying him out. Even then, he lost his job and has not been able to find work since. He is nonetheless willing to talk to anyone in Havana interested in the de la Fé case, and works constantly in behalf of his friend. The Journalists  Ramiro de la Fé, Ernesto’s brother, is also a journalist, and also out of a job (along with, it should be added, 50 percent of the Cuban labor force). He is the most active and outspoken of Ernesto’s defenders. He was the only man I met in Havana who had the courage to tell me: “Use my name whenever you want, as often as you like. I cannot stand by with my arms folded. ” He is, he told me, determined to “fight the Western war, the war against Communism. It is the really important war. ” Also in de la Fé’s camp, with very limited influence, are a great many Cuban journalists, many of them newspapermen whom he helped while serving as Minister of Information. They are ready to tell anyone, off the record, of de la Fé’s victimization. They will not be quoted, and they will not write the story for their own newspapers. “Castro,” said one, “says there is freedom of the press. But he adds that he reserves the right to answer his critics ‘with the people.’ That can mean anything from boycotting to mob violence. That we cannot risk. ” The popular humor magazine Zigzag recently lampooned the revolutionary government. That is your right, Castro commented, but it is also the right of the people to let you know how they feel about ridiculing so sacred a thing as their revolution. The people caught on: and imposed a boycott that almost bankrupted the magazine which promptly made amends. It is now sanguinely satisfied with things as they are. These newsmen also failed Ernesto de la Fé when he most needed them  —   when they had the opportunity to reflect, in their actions, some small measure of the courage of their colleague. They voted, instead, to expel him from the National Association of Journalists  —   the same sycophantic organization that had named Batista its Member Number One. “Perhaps,” wrote Ernesto de la Fé in the last communication he succeeded in passing out of La Cabaña, on learning of their repudiation of him, “they are mistaken in thinking they will please Fidel. Julius Caesar never forgave that eunuch, Potinus . . . for beheading General Pompey . . . The brave do not like cowardly acts. ” Journalists outside Cuba, on the other hand, have been outspoken. Newspapers throughout Latin America have taken up his cause. Telegrams of protest have flooded the offices of the Prime Minister and the provisional government. Enrique Castro Sarias, a Mexican newspaper col umnist, has issued a “Call to Free Men”: “I send a call to all truly democratic consciences from the Rio Grande to the cold lands of the North to stop this injustice, to raise their voices and ask  —   nay, demand  —   the freedom of this courageous   fighter. ” Jorge Prieto Laurens has written letters to newspapers and interested individuals all over the hemisphere on de la Fé’s behalf. Every communication received by the Cuban government requesting information on de la Fé is answered as in the letter reproduced below from Dr, Juan Orta, Director General of the Premier’s staff, to Mr. Marvin Liebman. The rhetoric is dis tinctly Communist: Ernesto is a Fascist, a traitor, an informer, and a   and anyone who undertakes to defend him is suspect. III. THE MEANING, Emesto de la Fé is entitled to be the object of the humanitarian impulses of the free world for the simple rea son that he is a human being who made his mistake, worked mightily to overcome it, squared off bravely to the greatest danger of our time, and now has been ruthlessly victimized. But his fate is something more than personal, and there is little his friends can do about it, much as they would like to withdraw him from the limelight. The trial of Ernesto de la Fé is also the trial of Fidel Castro. The treatment of de la Fé will throw considerable light, more light indeed than any other specific decision, on how fares Castro’s struggle against the Communists for preeminence in Cuban affairs. That Castro is ringed by Communists is a dogged fact, documented fully by Stuart Novins in his cele brated CBS telecast, by the special New York Times report, by U. S. News  World Report, by the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee, even by Cuban newspapermen themselves, however circumspect their language. It is a fact visible to anyone who has an eye for political reality. But it is not yet established, by any means, that Castro, should he will to do it, could not rise above the Communists, cast them out, and survive. It is not established that Castro himself is a Communist, or that he is prepared to subordinate his mystical evangelism to the hard and devious demands of the Communist party line. Two weeks ago Castro’s 26 of July Party delivered a resonant drubbing to the Communists in a number of   elections. In the past ten days, Revolución, Castro’s official revolutionary newspaper, went after Bias Roca and the Communist party, accusing them of making divisive attacks on national unity, of profiteering from a Cuba in distress. Last week Castro decreed that civilian political prisoners will be tried by civil courts instead of military   a move that diminishes the authority over the trials of the bloodthirsty Che Guevara. It has been weeks since the last execution in Cuba. In spite of Castro’s lunatic economic measures of the past weeks  —   e. g. expropriation of sugar plantations at just the moment when his survival depends on the seduction of foreign capital  —   he shows signs of slowing down, of tempering. He has dismissed the feasibility of Cuban neutrality in a war between East and West. He has discovered that the serious problems of governing a nation are more difficult, more tedious, less theatrical, than the frenzied bloodletting and demagogic blitzkriegs which characterized his government during the first months. Castro does not view himself as an agent of the Communist revolutionary ideal, and his people do not see him in that light. He is their embodiment the embodiment of a depressed Cuba of mutilated little streets and starving dogs and fat women leaning from windows, listening to strange music of pimps and shoeshine boys and taxicab drivers and barroom Bacardi perennials. Throughout the bazaar streets of Havana the banners, blouses, and    of his Revolution are on display. In him the people have vested their romantic hopes  —   that a man with a machine gun and a knapsack full of ideals can wrest them from poverty and degradation. So long as Cuba is embodied in a single person, that person is indispensable to the Communists as the instrument of their policy. A showdown will have to come. It will not come over economics  —   socialist Castro and the Communists move in concert in economic policy. Their politics diverge where other things are concerned, principally foreign policy. It is in foreign policy, in education and religion, that the clash could come and in the treatment of   newspapermen. Whence the crucial role of Ernesto de la Fé. Fidel Castro cannot succeed in persuading himself that de la Fé has a residual debt to pay for his sometime alliance with Batista: not after so spectacular a record of penitence. It will be clear, no matter how successfully the Communists ring the court with their special bombast, that de la Fé is the first clear test of the degree of Castro’s reliance on the Communists. Let him set the man free, and he has taken a large step forward toward independence of them. Should he free de la Fé, he would also perform a symbolic act not easily lost upon the Latin American consciousness.  —   John Leonard was a literary and cultural critic.

Allies’ best war photographer in Army’s biggest battle	2014-12-26	2014	12	 (CNN) The U. S. Army calls World War II’s Battle of the Bulge, a   campaign in the Ardennes Forest of Belgium that began on December 16, 1944, ”arguably the greatest battle in American military history.” British Prime Minister Winston Churchill concurred, calling it ”undoubtedly the greatest American battle of the war.” So it was entirely appropriate the man widely considered the world’s best war photographer, Robert Capa, was embedded with U. S. troops during a portion of the battle. Capa’s photos in the accompanying gallery were taken in just a short time at the end of December 1944, according to Cynthia Young, curator of the International Center for Photography’s Capa Archive.  Young said while Capa drew acclaim for his action photos, those he took at the Battle of the Bulge are of a different nature. ”The images of dead soldiers, a farmer burying a dead horse in the snow and German prisoners corralled with their hands raised attest to the bleakness of this deadly campaign,” Young said. Capa, who Young describes as ”decidedly ” was not an impartial observer of the war, but rather an official Allied photographer. ”He photographed for the American and English press to inform readers of the war in the hope that his photographs would help garner Allied support,” Young said. You’ll see several photos of German prisoners in the accompanying gallery. Young said that Capa would only photograph German soldiers if they were prisoners. Despite Capa’s  Allied status, he cast anything but a military appearance, according to Kenneth Koyen, a U. S. Army public relations officer who assisted Capa during the Battle of the Bulge. Writing in the History of Photography (reprinted online on evesmag. com) Koyen relates how that appearance almost cost Capa his freedom when Koyen escorted Capa into a U. S. Army intelligence headquarters where an intelligence officer, Lt. Col. Harry Brown, was working on a   map of battle positions. ”’Arrest that man! Get him out of here! ’” Brown shouted as he tried to conceal the map from Capa, who was wearing a pilfered German fur coat, according to Koyen’s account.  Koyen was able to convince the colonel of Capa’s allegiance, but the photographer’s appearance almost cost him again later in the battle, when U. S. soldiers began shooting at Capa, Koyen wrote. Koyen stepped in and waved the GIs off, he wrote. And then: ”Capa and I exchanged a long glance. Without a word, he took off the fur coat and stowed it in the (jeep).”  Those GIs were among the 1 million soldiers who fought in the Battle of the Bulge. More than 100, 000 Germans and 67, 000 Americans were casualties, according to the National WW II Museum. The battle was considered finished on January 28, 1945, when German forces were pushed back to positions they occupied when their offensive began six weeks earlier. Learn more about Capa at the International Center for Photography’s Capa at 100 page, which includes the only known recording of Capa’s voice, a radio interview from 1947. Robert Capa was a Hungarian photojournalist known for his photographs covering five wars. He died on assignment in 1954.
Camera selfies: Turning the lens on themselves	2014-12-29	2014	12	 (CNN) You won’t see any pouty lips or peace signs in these selfies. The criticized and laughable trend has spread to the devices used to capture them.  Prepping for their ultimate   vintage cameras docked on old tripods pucker up for their own selfie against backdrops that bring out their best qualities. No filters necessary.  These unusual photos offer a view of the oft forgotten film cameras that brought us to the digital age and ushered in the selfie.  Wanting to capture the rich history of analog in a modern, striking fashion, photographer and engineer Jürgen Novotny developed CameraSelfies, a continuing project featuring cameras from the 1920s onward.  Novotny has a personal tie to some of these antique cameras: The Agfa Silette was a gift from his father when he turned 6. It gave him the outlet to deal with his ”creative boosts,” he said, the freedom to isolate moods and generate ”special, subjective views on a situation.” This passion turned into a portfolio with styles ranging from still life to surreal landscapes. Novotny could think of no better way to pay homage to the medium of his work than by having the cameras themselves display their true colors. He began to collect historic cameras from friends or on auction sites like eBay for little to nothing. ”I learned that nondigital cameras seemed in fact to be forgotten . .. beautiful and still great equipment I couldn’t afford a few years ago are now available for a few bucks. Good for me, but somehow sad,” Novotny said, reminding him a bit of the ”Toy Story” movie. ”What if those abandoned and forgotten cameras would try to depict themselves and their situation? Without users anymore, looking back upon their glorious times?” he said. Thus, the idea for CameraSelfies was born. The photographs themselves are not selfies in the traditional definition. Novotny captures them with his modern, digital Fujifilm   in a small modest studio. ”I tried to capture them in their ’natural’ and chronologically correct environment, on backgrounds of contemporary wallpapers,” he said. CameraSelfies uses the ”selfiemania,” trend to remind the viewer of the origins of photography, and also keep in mind that expressive photography is more than noise reduction, smile detection and technical specifications, he said. ”These cameras are not only tools reduced to their technical data, but also still an inspiration for artists and a source for creativity. Here, the viewer is out of the frame, the cameras and the creative potential they offer stand in the foreground.” Jürgen Novotny is a photographer based in Germany.

Luise Rainer, back-to-back Oscar winner, dead at 104	2014-12-30	2014	12	 (CNN) Luise Rainer, who won    Oscars in the 1930s for ”The Great Ziegfeld” and ”The Good Earth” only to quit Hollywood at the height of her fame, has died.  She was 104. Rainer’s death was first reported by her daughter, Francesca Knittel Bowyer, on Twitter. ”Mummy had the fragility of an orchid, the energy of a hummingbird, the tenacity of a hunter.  She could change calm waters into a raging storm with a look and the lift of a finger,” Bowyer told CNN in an email. ”My heart is a hole without her, but that hole will definitely be filled with incredible memories, sweet, salty and funny. I want her memory to linger with those who knew her and be given to those who did not.” Rainer, who was born in Dusseldorf, Germany, in 1910, was a   European actress when she was brought to America by MGM in 1935 in the belief she could be the next Greta Garbo. She immediately came through on their investment with her star turn in 1936’s ”The Great Ziegfeld,” winning a best actress Oscar.  She repeated the achievement with 1937’s ”The Good Earth,” based on Pearl S. Buck’s novel, in which she played   the wife of protagonist Wang Lung. With that prize, she became the first actress to win consecutive best actress Academy Awards    a feat not equaled until Katharine Hepburn pulled off the trick for 1967’s ”Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner” and 1968’s ”The Lion in Winter.” To date, they are the only actresses to have done so. Both Spencer Tracy and Tom Hanks have done so in the best actor category, and Jason Robards won two straight supporting actor Oscars. But unlike Hepburn, who enjoyed a long career in movies despite the vagaries of fame, Rainer’s life as a Hollywood star was      by her own choice. She had frequent battles with MGM boss Louis B. Mayer and didn’t like the roles she was offered. ”All kinds of nonsense,” she told the UK’s Telegraph news site in 2009. ”I didn’t want to do it, and I walked out. Mayer said, ’That girl is a Frankenstein, she’s going to ruin our whole firm.’ He said, ’We made you and we are going to destroy you.’ ”   Instead, Rainer turned the tables and left MGM. Her marriage, to playwright Clifford Odets, had fallen apart (partly over his envy of her friendship with Albert Einstein, who ”liked my vivaciousness,” she said) and she returned to Europe. She married Robert Knittel, a publisher, in 1945. The two were married for more than 40 years, until his death in 1989.  She made a film for Paramount, ”Hostages,” in 1943, but that was it until 1997, when she appeared in a British production of Doestoyevsky’s ”The Gambler.” She had other opportunities    Federico Fellini asked her to appear in 1960’s ”La Dolce Vita,” but she had a   with the Italian director before filming    though she didn’t lament leaving movies.  Her life was quite full, with famous friends    Arturo Toscanini and Thomas Mann among them    and plenty of activity, including a few plays and TV roles.  She wasn’t easily impressed, by Hollywood or fame. Asked about the Nobel   Russian author Alexander Solzhenitsyn, who stayed with her and Knittel in London once, she told the Telegraph that he was ”terrible.” ’’You could not talk to him about anything except his own work, you know? He was so conceited, and demanding!” she said. Despite her long life, she told the Telegraph that she felt that there was so much more she wished to know. ”I know nothing. Nothing!” she said. ”My God, one’s lifespan is so very short.” At the time, she was just shy of 100. Rainer is survived by her daughter, two granddaughters and two  . People we’ve lost in 2014

2015: Try the power of radical empathy (Opinion)	2014-12-30	2014	12	 (CNN) I recently read seven words that shook me to the core. In a mesmerizing interview  in the new Smithsonian magazine, the civil rights historian Taylor Branch describes the three Freedom Riders who were killed in Mississippi 50 summers ago. All three had understood the dangers of going into the Deep South to register black voters. All had been trained in the practice of radical nonviolence. One of them, Michael Schwerner, lived out that ethic as he faced the   Klansman who was about to murder him. Schwerner said to the man, calmly, ”Sir, I know just how you feel.” Then the man shot him and his two friends. Think about that. Put yourself in Schwerner’s shoes. Imagine what it would have taken to summon such stillness, such profound and sincere compassion for one’s killer, at the moment of death. And then put yourself in the shoes of that Klansman. After all, we know this story only because the Klansman later told it to investigators. He was haunted, for the rest of his life, by the depth of empathy that he confronted in that fateful instant.   This story has stayed with me too, challenging me to admit it when in my comfortable everyday existence I fail to demonstrate even a fraction of that empathy and  . But it’s stayed with me in my civic identity as well. And it’s made me wonder how much of our political and civic strife could be alleviated if we learned something from a young man who’s been dead a half century but never gave in to fear or hate. Look around our country today. Look at the New York policemen who feel so insulted that they think they must turn their backs on their mayor. Look at the   citizens of that city who feel that the NYPD has never shown them the respect those disgruntled officers now demand. Look at the online comment threads after Ferguson and Staten Island. Look at how black men in hoodies and white men with badges are demonized. Look at the escalation of outrage that leads to philosophical hashtag wars about whether #BlackLivesMatter or #AllLivesMatter.  Look at the disgust that drips from the lips of Democrats as they brace for a reactionary GOP Congress and from Republicans as they decry imperious Democrats. Errol Louis: There are two sides to America’s policing issues, Look now at the people in your own community. Look at the way we walk past people whose circumstances are radically different from our own. Perhaps they are richer or poorer than you, or more liberal or less, or more   or less. Look at the way we ascribe moral meaning to those differences. Look at the way we tell ourselves stories about what our selves are. Look at the way those stories always accuse others of faults and excuse us for our own. Look at the way those solipsistic habits, which start with those closest to us, radiate outward. I have been guilty of this kind of   both personal and political. So have you. And for all of us, this season is an occasion to ask what it would take to earn the right to say these words: I know just how you feel. To some people, this kind of radical compassion and loving nonviolence seems dangerously squishy, a slide down the slope to moral relativism. They fear that understanding the heart of another person, particularly the enemy, will lead to an obliteration of distinctions between self and other, between right and wrong.  But that’s not how it was for Michael Schwerner and for the other Freedom Riders. They had a   understanding of the moral differences between them and the   defenders of Jim Crow, between good and evil. Their capacity for empathy empowered them    not to subdue others but to invite them into goodness and thereby transform them.   This power does not come easily. It takes a lot to say truly, in the heat of conflict, that you know how your adversary feels. And to say nothing more    no letting him off the hook, no further demonstrations of your goodness. Frankly, few of us will ever attain the   disciplined   of young Schwerner.  But more of us can come closer. And when few of us even bother trying, we get the political culture of today: polarization for its own sake politics as a game of annihilation rather than repeat play citizens as bloodthirsty spectators. As we begin the new year, as conflicts over race and class and guns and belonging continue to rage across the land, let’s resolve to learn just how someone feels. And to let that knowledge guide our lives as citizens. ​  Read CNNOpinion’s new Flipboard magazine. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook. .
Teen’s death shows horror of flu epidemic	2014-12-31	2014	12	 (CNN) Shannon Zwanziger seemed perfectly healthy. She was an active    who rarely got sick and hadn’t been to a doctor in more than three years. This story was first published in December, 2014. Then one day, she came home with the flu. She died a week later.  Shannon is part of grim new statistics released this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that the flu has reached an epidemic level in the United States this year.  It’s blamed for more deaths than it was at this time last year    including 15 children. That’s as of December 20. Already, more   deaths are suspected, including a    boy in Port Isabel, Texas, CNN affiliate KGNS reports. It’s still early in the flu season, which often begins in early fall and persists through May, so it remains to be seen exactly how pervasive the flu will be.  Passed out in her mother’s arms, never came to, Shortly before she died on December 9, Shannon had worked her way    slowly    down the stairs at home by sitting and sliding down each step. She eventually made her way to the bathroom to take a bath. ”I helped her get in the bathtub, but when I saw her eyes, I said, ’I think this is a mistake    we’ve got to get you out of here,’ ” her   mother, Gwen, in Owatonna, Minnesota, told CNN on Wednesday. ”She couldn’t help me get her out. So I lifted her up, and she passed away in my arms.” Technically, Shannon was still alive, but she never regained consciousness. Zwanziger began administering    resuscitation and screamed for her husband, Terry, who called 911. Emergency medical workers rushed Shannon to a hospital, which found a slight heartbeat and flew her to a larger hospital. After a few hours, her heart stopped altogether. ”She was such an incredible kid,” Gwen Zwanziger said by phone. ”She had her whole life planned out. She was living life to the fullest. If you’re going to have the perfect kid, she was it.” Zwanziger had taken her daughter to a clinic at the hospital when she first became ill. She was told that her sickness was the flu and would run its course at home. The Zwanzigers cared for her, gave her liquids and did everything they were told. But Zwanziger says the family later learned that at some point, Shannon’s liver gave out. And an autopsy confirmed that she had a type A flu. The CDC said that because of privacy rules, it can say only that there were two ”confirmed reports of   deaths in Minnesota this season.” It will be several more weeks before autopsy results show whether Shannon had an underlying health issue that the family was unaware of, Zwanziger says.  The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends an annual physical exam throughout childhood after the age of 4. But a study found that one third of Minnesota teens ages 13 to 17 had no preventive care visits, and another 40% had only one such visit during those years. Medical care not enough, When Shannon became sick, Zwanziger says, she got excellent medical care, but it wasn’t enough. She wants more people suffering from symptoms to have blood tests. Shannon had not had the vaccine. Her father was vaccinated, but her mother was not because she had a bad reaction to a swine flu vaccine in the 1970s, she said. (”If a person has had a serious allergic reaction to flu vaccines in the past, this might be a contraindication to getting one, but they should talk with their doctor to understand if that reaction is relevant to the decision to get a vaccine now,” says Dr. Joseph Bresee, chief of the Epidemiology and Prevention Branch of the CDC’s Influenza Division.) The Zwanzigers gave their daughter a choice, and she chose to forgo the vaccine. It’s unknown whether the vaccine would have saved her. Bad year for the vaccine, The CDC said it does not yet have information on how many of those killed by the flu this year were vaccinated. It’s an unusually bad year for the vaccine. Just over half the strains tested were not covered by it. The biggest reason is a mutated strain that was not being spread at the time the vaccine was designed. Predicting the flu to help avoid it, Still, getting vaccinated is ”the best way to reduce the chances that you will get seasonal flu and spread it to others” and ”may make your illness milder if you do get sick,” according to the CDC.  ”It’s still about 61% effective,” Dr. Seema Yasmin, a CNN medical analyst, said. ”Most flu vaccines protect against three or four different strains of flu actually, so even if it’s not a great match against one particular strain, it will still protect you against the other strains that are going around right now.” Alarming numbers, While alarming, the latest statistics don’t indicate that the outbreak this year will be, overall, worse than in previous years, the CDC told CNN on Wednesday. It’s too early to know. Flu activity is high in nearly half the country    22 states and Puerto Rico, according to a map released by the CDC. An infectious disease specialist with the Inova health care system in Fairfax, Virginia, said medical staff has been busy. ”We’ve seen more patients than we anticipated,” Dr. Sujata Ambardar told CNN affiliate WJLA. ”The hope is that things will stabilize, but I don’t see it stopping anytime soon.” The ”epidemic threshold” is crossed to some extent every year, a CDC chart shows. In the week ending December 20, nearly 7% of deaths were blamed on pneumonia and flu. That’s higher than it was at the same time last year, but later on in the season, the percentage of deaths blamed on the flu generally goes higher. The number of children killed by the flu spiked tremendously in 2013.   deaths were blamed on the flu in the 2011 to 2012 season the next season,   there were 171 deaths, the CDC says. In the 2013 to 2014 season, the figure was 109.  The 2009 season, which stretched from April 2009 to October 2010 and included the H1N1 pandemic, saw 348 deaths.  Totals are known for children but not adults because child deaths must be reported to the CDC there’s no similar requirement for adult deaths. Older people are generally those  .   hospitalizations among people 65 and older has reached 38. 3 per 100, 000 people, the highest rate of any age group, the CDC says. Flu activity generally peaks in the United States between December and February. The not knowing, Gwen Zwanziger says she did not catch the flu from her daughter, even after administering    resuscitation. Mixed in with all the pain and grief the family is suffering is the frustration of not knowing how the death happened. ”I just cannot figure out why she died from this,” the grieving mother says. CNN had contacted an online fundraising campaign for the Zwanziger family    her parents and her sister, who is married and has a baby    to learn more about the girl’s death. Organizers got back in touch, saying Gwen Zwanziger wanted to talk and deliver a message: ”We need to take it more seriously. And you need to be really proactive.”
Call to empathy after transgender teen’s death(Opinion)	2014-12-31	2014	12	 (CNN) Last weekend, a    apparently committed suicide in Ohio. And because she was transgender, many assigned a political or social or religious narrative to her story before even fully recognizing her death.  A disturbing trend when you consider the string of recent dramatic and, it must be said, senseless deaths that have crowded the nation’s headlines. Looking through the   prisms that helped define 2014, they all appear disconnected. But when we pause, we can see they are anything but.   Consider what happened earlier this month, when Kathleen McCartney, president of Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, sent a campuswide email in support of students protesting grand jury decisions not to charge the police officers who killed Michael Brown in Ferguson and Eric Garner in Staten Island. In it she said: ”We are united in our insistence that all lives matter.” Later, McCartney was forced to apologize. You see, because she didn’t specifically say ”black lives matter,” she was accused of minimizing the pain and experience that was specific to the black community. I would argue ”all lives matter” is every bit as revolutionary of a rallying cry and should hardly be said in shame. I thought about her apology after a man who was reportedly mentally ill drove from Baltimore to Brooklyn and shot two police officers in the head while they were at work. And I’m thinking about her apology now as my heart aches over the suicide of Leelah Alcorn, the teenager who took apparently took her life on Sunday. ”The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren’t treated the way I was, they’re treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights,” she wrote on Tumblr hours before stepping in front of a   on Interstate 71. She also wrote: ”my death needs to mean something,” obviously feeling her life did not.  If you fail to see the connection between Alcorn, the fallen police officers, Brown and Garner, then you are missing something important about what binds a society.  Laws and culture form sturdy beams, but the foundation of civilization is empathy. It is a slender but invaluable thread that allows us to communicate with those who speak a different language, explains why men double over at the sight of a male being struck in the groin, why our own eyes fill with tears at others’ sorrow and loss and why laughter is contagious. Our innate ability to identify with the needs and experiences of others    to have compassion, empathy    is the very thing that makes us human. Thus, the less empathy we have for others    the less ”all lives matter” to us    the less civilized we become. The less civilized we become, the less human we are. Of course, the notion that ”all lives matter” does not speak directly to the implicit biases that have led to the criminal justice system’s mistreatment of people of color. It does not highlight the sacrifices law enforcers make or the dangers they face each day. ”All lives matter” does not note the discrimination and ostracization of transgender people that apparently led to the torment felt by Leelah Alcorn    discrimination and ostracization that even occurs within the larger lesbian, gay and bisexual community. But it does remind us that before we are black, white, Christian, liberal or gay, we are human. Because in the end, the lapses in humanity that led to each of the   deaths that have rocked our culture may be different in their particulars, but they are the same in the pain experienced by loved ones left behind.  Over my   years as a journalist, I have covered numerous deaths. I can tell you about the agony in the eyes of the mother of Matthew Shepard, the    gay man who was   tied to a fence and eventually died back in 1998 it is similar to the pain in the eyes of Trayvon Martin’s mother. The cries I heard at the memorial service for Michael Brown this past summer were as hard to hear as the cries I heard at a service for Wes Leonard, a    who collapsed and died on his high school’s basketball court three years ago. Again, the circumstances surrounding each death are vastly different from one another. But when a parent buries a child, the hurt is hard to differentiate. There is a time to dissect mitigating circumstances, but it should not come before experiencing humanity and learning something from how we feel.  It is a constant struggle to hold on to what connects us. Especially when so many forces    politics, media, religion    flood in to demonize our differences, alienate one group of people from another, drown our compassion and leave our very humanity gasping for air. A    transgender girl took her own life during the holiday season. Before we point fingers assigning blame, can we at least pause long enough to think about the meaning of a girl’s lost life? To mourn? To feel? To be human? Read CNNOpinion’s new Flipboard magazine. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook. . 
Mike Rowe discusses Ferguson, Garner and police protest	2014-12-31	2014	12	 (CNN) Editor’s note: Mike Rowe’s essay about the deadly arrests of Mike Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in New York has struck a chord. It touches on the topics of police behavior and resisting arrest. The essay was first posted as a response to a fan’s question on Rowe’s Facebook page: Programming note: CNN’s Mike Rowe    host of ”Somebody’s Gotta Do It”     meets unique people across America who perform unusual jobs. Follow him at mikeroweworks. com and Mikerowe. com.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mike Rowe.  ”Hello Mr. Mike Rowe. I’m a big fan and also happen to work in the lower Haight as well as live in Alameda. I have to ask, with everything that is going on in Ferguson, how do you feel about the protests in San Francisco as well as the   in downtown Oakland? Hi Meghan, Last week, those very protests blocked off one of the major arteries, and as a result, I was 90 minutes late to a holiday dinner in Alameda. I apologized for my tardiness, and was told by my hostess not to give it a second thought. ’It’s a small price to pay,’ she said, ’given all that’s at stake.’ Another guest, already well into the eggnog, wondered aloud if a heart attack victim waiting for an ambulance stuck in traffic might hold a different view?  Within moments, everyone was talking about Garner and Brown, and the conversation got very political very quickly. A liberal guest said, ’Look, I wasn’t there, but it seems pretty clear that both men would still be alive had they been white.’ A conservative guest replied, ’I wasn’t there either, but it seems pretty clear that both men would still be alive if they hadn’t resisted arrest.’  This annoyed the liberal, who asked the conservative why Republicans wanted a ’police state.’ This annoyed the conservative, who asked the liberal why Democrats wanted ’total anarchy.’ Things continued to escalate, and within moments, fingers were pointing, veins were bulging, and logical fallacies were filling the air. Ho! ho! ho! For once, I kept my mouth shut and listened as a roomful of decent people tore each others throats out. It was remarkable, because no one disagreed on the big points. No one disagreed that black lives mattered just as much as white lives. No one disputed that racial bias in law enforcement should be exposed and eliminated. In fact, no one disagreed about the basic facts surrounding each case. The breakdown happened over relevance and context. My conservative friends were focused on the fact that both men died while resisting arrest, and were therefore responsible for their own demise. They wanted to discuss the killings in light of the incredible risk that all police officers agree to assume.  My liberal friends were focused on the fact that both men were unarmed, and were therefore victims of excessive force. They wanted to discuss the killings in the context of historical trends that suggest bias plays a recurring role in the way cops treat minorities.  By dessert, it was clear that both sides wanted law and order. But the conservatives were convinced that order is only possible when citizens treat cops with respect. Liberals, on the other hand, were arguing that order can only occur when cops treat everyone the same. And round and round we went. The chicken and the egg. Later, on the drive home, I called a friend of mine back in Baltimore. He’s black, successful, and  . He also resents the way he’s gotten swept into the zeitgeist of Ferguson. In his words, ’I’m a pawn in someone else’s agenda, and I’m sick of it. I know what bias looks like in my life. I’m tired of being represented by two petty criminals who died resisting arrest.’  I hadn’t thought about it like that, but he’s got a point. The vast majority of black Americans have never broken the law. And yet, millions of lives are now entwined with the death of Brown and Garner. That’s not fair, but it’s hardly breaking news. Minorities are constantly stereotyped and the impression lingers. Looters and arsonists run amok, and Black America suffers the association. Now I’m trying to get my head around the fact that two cops are dead in Brooklyn, assassinated by a lunatic in ’retaliation’ for Ferguson and Staten Island. Unbelievable.  How much worse can it get for the millions of   minorities, struggling to be seen as individuals? How much worse can it get for the thousands of honest cops, trying to protect a citizenry that doesn’t seem to appreciate their daily sacrifice?  A few days ago, people were marching in the streets, literally calling for the execution of police. (’What do we want? Dead Cops! ’) Others are standing by today, waiting to lionize the assassins who answer the call. These are not the champions of justice these are the enemies of civilization, and it’s up to sensible people on both sides of the aisle to close ranks and shout them down. If we want to live in a nation of laws, we need to support the humans sworn to uphold them. They’re a lot of really great cops out there who have promised to do that very thing, including the one in my family. We’d be screwed without them.  To answer your question Meghan, I support peaceful protests, and I’m all for rooting out bad cops. But let’s not stop there. If we’re serious about saving lives, and eliminating the confrontations that lead to the demise of Garner and Brown, let’s also condemn the stupidity that leads so many Americans to resist arrest.  I don’t care if you’re white, black, red, periwinkle, burnt umber, or chartreuse    resisting arrest is not a right, it’s a crime. And it’s never a good idea.

Search for AirAsia Flight QZ8501 slowed by weather	2014-12-31	2014	12	Surabaya, Indonesia (CNN) Indonesian searchers battling bad weather in their efforts to find more remains from AirAsia Flight QZ8501 have so far recovered seven bodies from the sea, officials said Wednesday.  A day after the first bits of debris from the commercial jet were spotted afloat off the coast of Borneo, the search operation was hampered Wednesday by big waves, strong winds and heavy rain. Helicopters scanning for signs of wreckage and victims were halted in their search, while ships continued combing the waters. It was unclear how long aerial operations would be held up.  Answers about why the aircraft, with 162 people on board, fell from the sky Sunday remained elusive. Among the seven bodies recovered so far    not 10, as earlier reports had indicated    was that of a woman wearing a flight attendant’s uniform, said Bambang Soelistyo, Indonesia’s national search and rescue chief.  ”Reality of seeing the evacuees and some of my aircraft parts are soul destroying,” AirAsia CEO Tony Fernandes tweeted. The air executive also put to rest rumors of a survivor found in a life jacket, saying that only the life jacket was found in the water. Sonar may have detected wreckage, There was conflicting information about whether any parts of the plane had been found underwater. One search official told CNN that he believes sonar equipment has detected wreckage from the plane at the bottom of the sea but couldn’t confirm it. ”I think that that’s the case,” said Muhammad Hernanto, the head of search and rescue for Surabaya, the Indonesian city where Flight 8501 began its journey Sunday.  But in a news conference Wednesday, Fernandes denied this, saying sonar imaging has yet to detect anything. ”Search and rescue teams are doing a fantastic job. They are narrowing the search and they are feeling more comfortable they are beginning to know where it is. But there is no confirmation of them. No sonar . .. nothing”  Soelistyo was also cautious, denying reports that searchers had found the plane’s main fuselage.  ”Until now, we haven’t found the plane,” he said, according to Indonesia’s national news agency Antara. Search teams are looking for other bodies and parts of the plane, including its   black boxes. Those could help investigators determine what went wrong on the flight, which lost contact with air traffic controllers after the pilot asked to change course and move to a higher altitude because of bad weather. How can a modern airliner vanish? Bodies returned to flight’s departure city, The difficult weather conditions were making it harder to get all the bodies that have been recovered back to land. Two of the corpses arrived at a hospital in Surabaya on Wednesday afternoon after being airlifted from a city nearer the search site. The bodies were given a solemn welcome by roughly 100 military personnel. Preparations have been made in Surabaya to receive and identify the human remains in the coming hours and days. Dozens of ambulances were lined up. On the grounds of a police hospital stood several refrigerated shipping containers where bodies will be stored while awaiting examination. Nearby, tents were pitched with gurneys on hand. Debris and some bodies were found Tuesday 100 to 200 kilometers (about 60 to 120 miles) from the aircraft’s last known location over the Java Sea, Indonesia’s search and rescue agency said. The news came as a devastating blow for family members of passengers, who had been waiting anxiously for information about their loved ones for days.  The suffering was made worse for some of them, when they saw live television pictures of a corpse in the water.  Anguish revisited: Relatives of MH370 victims speak out about AirAsia QZ8501, Families still want and expect regular and full updates from authorities, Suyone Thejakusuma, who said he had relatives and friends on the flight, told CNN on Wednesday. A new information center for families was being set up Wednesday next to a police station in Surabaya. International search effort, Several nations are contributing resources to the effort, including the United States, Singapore and Malaysia. The U. S. Navy destroyer USS Sampson is already supporting the search and recovery operations. The USS Fort Worth is also being prepared to deploy from Singapore, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said. It ”can be ready to sail in a day or two to get on station and can be there very quickly,” he said. The United States is also preparing maritime patrol aircraft that could help, he said. The flight, which was lost Sunday on its way to Singapore, was carrying 155 passengers and seven crew members. The overwhelming majority were Indonesians. There were also citizens of Britain, France, Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea aboard. Flight 8501 was operated by AirAsia’s Indonesian affiliate.
What (not) to look forward to in 2015	2014-12-31	2014	12	 (CNN) It’s time once again for that most hazardous exercise: guessing what the next year will bring around the world. There will be surprises, just as in 2014 the sudden rampage of ISIS, the Russian annexation of Crimea and the collapse in the crude oil price were all unforeseen. The consequences of those events, and many others besides, will leave their mark on 2015. But emerging themes may also come of age, such as the ”Internet of Things” and breakthrough trade deals that galvanize the world economy. But let’s start with the bad news:  ISIS is not going away, No one is predicting a swift defeat of ISIS, the   Islamic State, which has proved resilient in the six months since its sudden sweep through Iraq to the fringes of Baghdad. The easy pickings are fewer, the challenge of ”governing” sapping, air strikes debilitating. And a new Iraqi Prime Minister, Haider al Abadi, has begun to mend bridges with the country’s Sunni minority and reorganize the army.  But ISIS is still as much on the offensive as the defensive. It appears to accept the ebb and flow of conflict, switching between holding territory and classic terror tactics. It is constantly seeking ways to stretch Iraqi forces, which are still very much a work in slow progress.  Perhaps ISIS’ best hope in Iraq in coming months is that Sunnis north of Baghdad will turn to it if   militia persecute them. ISIS’ greatest vulnerability will be the expensive and   job of governing: providing social services, power and water, ensuring food supplies. There are already plenty of signs    in Iraq’s second city Mosul especially    that ISIS is failing on most of these counts.  At some point in 2015, Iraqi security forces will look to retake Mosul, but predictions of a New Year offensive seem optimistic. In Syria, there are signs that ISIS is looking to open up new fronts    south of Damascus and toward the Lebanese border, either itself or by   other factions. It holds territory north of Aleppo, ready to take advantage of other rebel groups being pummeled by the Assad regime.  The Syrian battlefield is very complicated, with alliances coming and going in a country of dozens of factions that spend as much time fighting each other as they do Bashar Assad. Military victory for the government or its opponents is as unlikely in 2015 as it was in 2014 or 2013.  Joshua Landis, a longtime Syria watcher at the University of Oklahoma, says ”The   of the country is inevitable so long as the international community degrades all centers of power in Syria and the opposition fails to unite.” Only a political settlement will end the bloodshed    as was the case in Lebanon and Bosnia in decades past. But that too appears remote, despite Russia taking on the mantle of mediator. The strongest factions include ISIS and the al Qaeda affiliate al Nusra    while moderate groups favored by the international community have lost ground. Even so, waging war for three years has taken its toll on the regime. Aron Lund in Syria Comment expects ”the regime’s fraying base: finances, infrastructure, and perhaps manpower” to become a critical factor in the coming year, noting its difficulty in fielding enough capable troops. And the regime’s main allies, Iran and Russia, are among the countries hit by lower oil prices (of which more later). The three million Syrians who have become refugees face another year in tents and shelters, with   of the children receiving little or no schooling, according to UNICEF. Arab world in turmoil, Iraqi Foreign Minister Ibrahim al Jaafari recently compared the rise of ISIS with the Thirty Years War that tore apart much of Europe in the 17th century. It’s difficult to argue with him as fifty shades of jihadism spread across the Arab world    from Benghazi in Libya to Sanaa in Yemen.  Four of the region’s largest countries are in the throes of civil war. The situation in Libya has deteriorated throughout 2014: now a chaotic mix of tribal and jihadist groups fight for territory and oil while a parliament evicted from Tripoli stands powerless on the sidelines. Oil production is less than a quarter of the level four years ago. Expect the situation in Libya to get still worse in 2015, with the absence of state authority also encouraging bigger flows of illegal migrants from   Africa to the Mediterranean. Libya’s chaos is likely to spill over, affecting weak neighbors like Niger, and the presence of jihadist camps in the desert may invite Egyptian military action. U. S. President Barack Obama recognized the   problems in the Arab world, and America’s limited ability to intervene, in his   National Public Radio interview. ”When it comes to what is going to be a generational project in a place like Libya or a place like Syria or a place like Iraq, we can help, but we can’t do it for them,” he said.  Obama made it clear that in the last 24 months of his presidency that he would not be rushed into   in the Middle East or anywhere else, saying the pundits in Washington ”think you can just move chess pieces around the table. And whenever we have that kind of hubris, we tend to get burned.” Iran: A deal? Obama also spoke of ”strategic patience”    which is very much on show in Washington’s gradual   to Tehran. A common enemy    ISIS    has led to a tacit understanding between the United States and Iran. Whether that opens the window to a broader relationship    and whether negotiations on Iran’s nuclear program will succeed    is one of the big questions of 2015.  Deadlines for agreement on limiting Iran’s nuclear program have come and gone: the next is July. The Obama administration has invested heavily in seeking a deal since President Hassan Rouhani’s election in 2013, and Rouhani is keen to show the Iranian people he can end their economic and political isolation. Obama, in his   interview with NPR, said he believed ”there are elements inside of Iran that recognize the opportunity and want to take it.”  Hardliners in Iran may see such an opening as undermining their influence and opening the door to all sorts of Western influences. The momentum appears to be flowing against them, but the gaps between Tehran and the international community remain formidable. Perhaps the best to be expected is an interim deal that further eases sanctions.   Afghanistan: A new beginning, It seemed like ”Happy Christmas: War is Over” in Kabul as the International Security Assistance Force this week lowered the flag and ended combat missions. The Taliban marked the ceremony by mocking the West for wasting billions of dollars and hundreds of lives.  Training and assistance to the Afghan military will continue, with some 13, 000 troops    most of them American    staying on under Operation Resolute Support. Some will conduct   operations, but are unlikely to be enough to stave off the Taliban’s resurgence in southern provinces.  We will also find out whether Hamid Karzai’s successor as Afghan President, Ashraf Ghani, can improve the regional dynamics. Ironically, one of the worst tragedies of 2014    the Pakistan Taliban attack on a school in Peshawar    may help him.   For years, Pakistan and Afghanistan have traded accusations (and occasionally gunfire) alleging the other supports terrorist groups. While the Afghan Taliban use Pakistani soil as a rear base, so the Pakistani Taliban slip into Afghanistan to avoid the military and to resupply.  CNN’s Nic Robertson on the horror of Pakistan school massacre, The day after the school atrocity, a senior Pakistani military official flew to Kabul to meet Ghani. Pakistan clearly wants action against the masterminds of the attack, at least one of whom was purportedly in Afghanistan. Ghani will want a quid pro quo, which Pakistan may be reluctant to provide. It has always seen the Afghan Taliban and associated groups like the Haqqani Network as a tool against Indian influence in Afghanistan. But the two governments already are stepping up border cooperation.  It’s rare that one event changes the direction of a region, but there does appear to be a rare window of opportunity for a more concerted campaign against terrorism. The history of the region suggests it may not stay open long. And the rugged territory of the region favors the insurgents.  A tax cut thanks to oil, By most forecasts, the world will be heavily reliant on the United States and China to drive growth this year. Goldman Sachs forecasts U. S. growth of 3% and China’s at 7% while much of Europe scrapes into positive territory.  The numbers may be improved by the suddenly lower price of oil. The International Monetary Fund says the sharp fall in the price of crude (down more than 40% since the summer) should add nearly 1% to global growth. Many (though not all) analysts expect the price to recover slightly, but only a catastrophe on the production side would see the price back above $100 a barrel.  For Europe, the United States and China, a lower oil price is good news. It’s essentially a tax cut for consumers. The Economist estimates that the average U. S. motorist could save $800. But economies heavily reliant on oil revenues    Nigeria, Russia and Venezuela for example    will suffer. So may heavily indebted oil companies. For every $1 drop in the price of crude, Venezuela is estimated to lose some $700 million in revenue, making it difficult to service debt and fund basic imports.  Stagnant global demand and the rise in U. S. shale oil production are two reasons for the fall in crude prices. Saudi Arabia’s decision not to cut its production is another some oil analysts believe the Saudis are trying to retain their market share and make ”nonconventional” sources such as shale less viable. Look out for bankruptcies among smaller shale producers. But for Russia, another problem, One of the safest predictions for 2015 is that Russians will have a tough year. Besides the sliding oil price, high interest rates to defend a vulnerable ruble, a shrinking economy and financial sanctions (slapped on Moscow by the United States and Europe because of Ukraine) are a toxic combination. The unanswerable question is how President Vladimir Putin will respond. Will he double down, seeking closer ties with China, India and the rest of Asia and causing mischief in the Baltics? Or will the Kremlin see the destabilization of Ukraine as not worth the candle?  Jeffrey Tayler in Foreign Policy asks whether ”needing to distract his people from ever direr economic straits, [Putin] could foment separatist sentiment in, say, the   Estonian town of Narva.”  Putin certainly sees an historic struggle under way. He told the Duma in December that ”the policy of containment [by Western powers] was not invented yesterday. It has been carried out against our country for many years, always, for decades, if not centuries.”  To Moscow, Ukraine’s bid for NATO membership is the latest iteration of that policy.  But Russia’s    and Ukraine’s    weakness may also provide scope for a deal. Ukraine satisfies few of the conditions for NATO membership and is unlikely to for years. What if Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel dangled guarantees that the Alliance will keep Ukraine at arm’s length and gradually eliminate sanctions in return for an end to the   rebellion in eastern Ukraine? Unicef sees ”extremely serious” plight for Ukrainian children, But until this frozen conflict finds a solution, Russian companies will suffer, unable to tap into international credit markets and more than ever reliant on loyalty to the Kremlin. And Russian citizens’ standard of living will be hurt by inflation and crippling interest rates. Europe in the doldrums, Cheaper oil just may help Europe dodge another recession. But the European Central Bank is not taking any chances. It’s planning to take a page from the playbook of the U. S. Federal Reserve through a massive program of ”Quantitative Easing” to buy sovereign bonds and shock the European economy into life. Most in need of the firepower: France and Italy.  If ECB President Mario Draghi and oil (and Germany) can’t drag Europe back into growth, the popular mood will continue to darken, benefiting parties like the     UKIP in Britain and protest party Podemos in Spain. The British vote is in May and few dare to predict the outcome. But it seems very likely that one or more of the smaller parties will be involved in coalition negotiations and the historic decline in the vote of the Labour and Conservative Parties will continue.  That same fragmentation has occurred in Greece, where snap elections could bring the radical   Syriza to power, unstitching the complex rescue that kept Greece inside the Eurozone. Mujtaba Rahman of the Eurasia Group says a ”Syriza government in Greece, part of a wider shift toward populism in Europe, will have the potential to generate contagion to France and Italy,” where unemployment is high and incumbent governments unpopular.  Greece set for snap general election, Across Europe, the political establishment is under siege from this populism, which on the left wants vast programs of public works and an end to austerity and on the right a hard line against immigration and European integration. In Germany, nearly 20, 000 people marched through Dresden in December under the banner ”Patriotic Europeans against the Islamization of the West.” From Finland to Portugal, elections in 2015 will be worth watching.  China’s pivot, A historic transition in under way in China: the ”pivot” from an economy based on being the ”workshop of the world” into one more sustained by domestic demand. The Chinese leadership is walking a fine line between growth and introducing structural reforms that include a crackdown on institutional corruption and curbing what’s known as ”shadow banking”    risky and loosely regulated lending estimated to be worth nearly $5 trillion. The coming year will be a critical stage in that transition. One ” ” conflict that will endure in 2015 is Beijing’s determination to remake the map of the South China Sea, of which it claims 80%. This assertive nationalism is driven by the promise of oil and gas and the importance of the region’s shipping lanes. New Chinese passports show the ”  line,” invented a century ago and brushing the territorial waters of Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. There have already been confrontations over some remote Pacific shoals other governments are queuing up to challenge China in international forums.  More skirmishes seem likely in the coming year, and the U. S. is being drawn into the dispute after recently rejecting the ”  line.” 9 stories that ”broke” China’s Internet in 2014, A big year for trade deals? Another testing ground for the world’s two largest economies will be trade. The recent U. S.  agreement to reduce tariffs on information technology goods is a hopeful sign, but Edward Alden at the Council for Foreign Relations notes that ”big developing countries like China, India and Brazil have matured into global players in their own right, making it harder to reach deals than it was when the United States and Europe called most of the shots.” A raft of international meetings in 2015 will be critical for the way the world manages trade: the   Partnership between the U. S. and Asian countries, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (U. S. ) and World Trade Organization (WTO) talks. None will be easy, but Republican control may actually help the Obama administration get   congressional approval for any agreements.  Critical to the fate of the ”Doha Round” of WTO talks will be the attitude of India, a country where vested interests have long opposed liberalization in trade and services. Narendra Modi’s BJP party came to power on a   platform, and its bilateral agreement with the United States in 2014 on food security paves the way for progress on the Doha Round. It’s also important for the WTO’s future. If the Doha Round dies, trade may become more about bilateral and ”bloc” deals.  The history of trade negotiations is that they always take longer than anticipated, so we may have to revisit the topic a year from now.  Climate talks getting warmer? Now insert the word ”climate” for ”trade” in that last sentence, and double it. The world has been waiting for meaningful progress on talks to curb carbon emissions since the Copenhagen summit five years ago. In the meantime, the earth keeps getting hotter    in 2014 it was 1 degree Fahrenheit warmer than the   average. A lot is riding on the Paris conference to be held in December. In the wake of the preparatory meeting in Lima, Peru, in November, it seems ambitions have been pared to the lowest common denominator. A final deal will be based on national plans to be submitted by individual governments by April 1. Lima also produced a fudge on the issue of how developing nations would contribute to overall goals.  Few environmental groups are optimistic that anything meaningful and binding will emerge in Paris, and the fund to help emerging nations adapt their infrastructure is worth a tenth of the $100 billion target. Life on Mars, In the last few weeks, a little vehicle called Curiosity was trundling across a crater on Mars when it picked up wild fluctuations in methane levels. Why would this be exciting? On Earth, most methane is produced biologically some of it is millions of years old, found deep underground. If the same were true of Mars, it would indicate some form of primitive life on the planet.  Much more needs to be done to identify the origin of the methane. But Michael Mumma, a senior scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, told Scientific American the discovery was ”very exciting because it very clearly shows methane has a source on the planet.” Maybe in 2015 Curiosity will come across another spike in methane and can gather ”enriched” air samples    which would help researchers identify the source of the methane. The presence of   the scientists say, would be cause for real excitement, as it would indicate a biological origin.  The Internet of Things, It’s a prosaic description of a complex and powerful phenomenon that is about to land on us    a massive surge in the data showing what we do, when and where. None of this happens in a calendar year of course, but by 2020 according to IT industry analysts Gartner there will be 26 billion connected devices generating and consuming data, assisted by the explosion in wearable technology such as smart glasses and watches. So businesses will invest heavily in 2015 (and beyond) in data storage, analysis and retrieval. Knowing how to classify the data, what to keep and what to discard, what to hold locally and what to store in the cloud, will all be critical to smart use of this insane amount of information.   Susan Hauser of Microsoft expects businesses to ”make use of big data services in the cloud and we expect machine learning to grow exponentially across the retail, manufacturing and health care sectors.” ”Deep learning” will be a big part of this process    whereby computers are designed to behave more like the human brain thanks to ”deep neural networks” enabling them to learn through observation. We are getting close to the point where machines will make better decisions than us.  As Anthony Wing Kosner writes in Forbes: ”This will not be the year that 80% of the developed world loses their jobs to intelligent machines, but it is not too soon to start figuring out what to do about that eventuality.” Maybe one of them will be writing this column next year. The whistle blows for FIFA, The governing body of world football    FIFA    has spent the last year embroiled in crisis over the way Russia and especially Qatar were chosen to host the next two World Cups. An inquiry was commissioned but its findings were so heavily ”interpreted” that the author    U. S. attorney Michael Garcia    quit in disgust. Now FIFA’s governing committee says it will publish a redacted version of the report. The question is whether this will bring about real reform at FIFA, where Sepp Blatter has reigned supreme for 16 years thanks to solid support from football’s backwaters. He faces   in May, and will need all that support. Despite persistent grumbling about siting the World Cup in Qatar, given its climate    and protests about casualties among workers building the stadiums there    it would be an enormous admission of failure on FIFA’s part to reopen the contest. Blatter is an astute tactician and a proven survivor odds are if he wants another term, he will get it. Which many in football would see as another own goal by FIFA.
Teen arrested for Hong Kong chalk protest	2014-12-31	2014	12	Hong Kong (CNN) A    girl in Hong Kong could be removed from her father’s care after she was arrested for drawing chalk flowers on a wall at one of the city’s   protest sites. The girl was arrested in the early hours of December 23 at a staircase leading to the Central Government Offices in the city’s Admiralty district and was detained by police for 17 hours, said Patricia Ho, the lawyer acting for the teen.  A judge ruled in a youth court on Monday that the girl should be sent to a children’s home for 20 days until January 19. On Wednesday, local media reported the girl was released from the children’s home on bail. The wall, known as the ”Lennon Wall,” was once covered with colorful   notes and messages of support for the recent   protests in Hong Kong. When the protests were cleared, the notes were removed as well. Protestors started placing notes on the wall as a show of defiance after police used tear gas on demonstrators at the start of the protest, which lead to a   occupation of the main road outside the Central Government Office. The wall was named after the late Beatles star John Lennon and contained messages of support for the protests and references to his song ”Imagine.” ’An innocent political prisoner’ Ho said the move was ”premature and disproportionate.” ”It wasn’t an application by the Social Welfare Department as it usually would be,” she said. ”Police threw in a bunch of facts they obtained about the family in a very superficial manner.” Meanwhile, the court is considering an application by Hong Kong police that she be removed from the care of her father who, according to Ho, is seriously hearing impaired and cannot understand the case. The move has angered activists student activist group Scholarism have set up a petition protesting the court ruling and some protestors have started drawing on the road as a protest outside the children’s home in Tuen Mun, where the teenager is being held. Gary Tsang, who participated in Hong Kong’s   street occupations, told CNN the teen was ”an innocent political prisoner” and the use of the law in this case was ”obviously politically motivated.” ”The government fears young people as they thinks young people have nothing to lose,” he said. Another protestor, Anson Chui, told CNN the police have lost their common sense and said there would be more similar arrests. ”Most (people). .. know that we cannot really cause any damage on the wall by drawing with chalk,” he said. ”It is just an excuse used by the police to make us fear. Especially when the court said they are taking away the girl from her father.” The move comes after police also made an application for a care or protection order for a teenage boy who was arrested during the clearance of another protest site in Mong Kok earlier this month. The court file said the boy’s parents failed to exercise proper guardianship over him.  The court dates for both teenagers will take place in January.  Continued resistance, A small protest camp outside the Legislative Council still remains and there is a small police presence on the site. Police officers are guarding Lennon Wall and remove all notes posted to it at the end of each day. New Year’s Eve countdown events at popular shopping districts such as Causeway Bay and Tsim Sha Tsui were canceled because of fears that protestors would attempt to hijack the events.  Since the protest sites were cleared, demonstrators have resorted to other forms of protest such as the   ”shopping revolution,” which involves protestors blocking the sidewalks and flooding shopping districts every night with yellow umbrellas. Hong Kong Police have not responded to requests for comment.
Ohio transgender teen’s mom: ’He was an amazing boy’	2014-12-31	2014	12	 (CNN) When Josh Alcorn voiced a desire to live as a girl, the Ohio teenager’s parents said they wouldn’t stand for that. ”We don’t support that, religiously,” Alcorn’s mother told CNN on Wednesday, her voice breaking. ”But we told him that we loved him unconditionally. We loved him no matter what. I loved my son. People need to know that I loved him. He was a good kid, a good boy.” Crossing out the name ”Josh,” the    signed the name ”Leelah” in a suicide note posted to Tumblr.  The note was programmed to publish after Alcorn’s death Sunday. The teenager was struck by a   on Interstate 71 about 2:15 a. m. about four miles from home in the tiny town of Kings Mills, northeast of Cincinnati.  The Ohio State Highway Patrol is investigating the death as a suicide. ”Please don’t be sad, it’s for the better. The life I would’ve lived isn’t worth living in . .. because I’m transgender,” the note said. ”I could go into detail explaining why I feel that way, but this note is probably going to be lengthy enough as it is. To put it simply, I feel like a girl trapped in a boy’s body, and I’ve felt that way ever since I was 4. I never knew there was a word for that feeling, nor was it possible for a boy to become a girl, so I never told anyone and I just continued to do traditionally ’boyish’ things to try to fit in.” The teenager’s death has ignited intensely emotional reactions across social media. The hashtag #LeelahAlcorn is carrying messages of support for all transgender people. Many posts are hateful and vengeful notes directed at the teen’s parents. In her interview with CNN, Carla Alcorn referred to her child as her son and used male pronouns. After the death, a Facebook post apparently from Carla Alcorn said her child ”went home to heaven this morning. He was out for an early morning walk and was hit by a truck. Thank you for the messages and kindness and concern you have sent our way. Please continue to keep us in your thoughts.” Some on social media have seized on that post and reposted her message, crossing out the male pronouns and the name Josh and replacing them with female pronouns and the name Leelah.  ’He just quit talking about it’ In Leelah’s note, she explains that when she was 14, she first understood what transgender meant and ”cried of happiness.” ”After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was. I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn’t make mistakes, that I am wrong. If you are reading this, parents, please don’t tell this to your kids,” the note says. ”Even if you are Christian or are against transgender people don’t ever say that to someone, especially your kid. That won’t do anything but make them hate them self. That’s exactly what it did to me.” Carla Alcorn told CNN that her child was depressed and that counselors and a psychiatrist gave the teenager medication.  ”He just quit talking about (being transgender),” she said.  She worried Wednesday that hateful messages directed toward her and her husband are making them out to be ”horrible people,” she said. She has other children, she said, and they are incredibly sad about losing a sibling.  She said that there has not been a service for the teen because people have threatened to protest.  Her child came to her only once to talk about being transgender, Carla Alcorn insisted.  The first time she heard the name Leelah was on the teen’s suicide note.  ”He never said that name before,” she said.   ’The cruelty of loneliness’ Leelah’s suicide note, however, says she struggled for a long time to gain her parents’ acceptance as a transgender teen. ”My mom started taking me to a therapist, but would only take me to christian therapists, (who were all very biased) so I never actually got the therapy I needed to cure me of my depression. I only got more christians telling me that I was selfish and wrong and that I should look to God for help.” At 16, she wrote that she realized her ”parents would never come around” and that she would have to wait until she was 18 to start any kind of medical treatment to transition to being a female.  That, she said, ”absolutely broke my heart. . .. I felt hopeless, that I was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life.” Carla Alcorn recalled her teen asking for transition surgery.  She told her child no, she said, because ”we didn’t have the money for anything like that.”  In her suicide note, Leelah said she cried herself to sleep that night. Leelah told her friends she was transgender. She came out as gay at school, a move that was supported by friends but made her parents angry, she wrote. ”They wanted me to be their perfect little straight christian boy, and that’s obviously not what I wanted.” Carla Alcorn said that she took away her child’s access to social media because the teen was looking at ”inappropriate” things on the Internet but would not say what those things were. Leelah describes what it was like to not have social media to connect with friends: ”This was probably the part of my life when I was the most depressed, and I’m surprised I didn’t kill myself. I was completely alone for 5 months. No friends, no support, no love. Just my parents’ disappointment and the cruelty of loneliness.” It all began to feel like too much weight to the teenager, she wrote. Convinced she had few friends, and feeling the pressure of saving enough money to move out of her home, keep her grades up and face people at church who she felt had only judgment for her, she decided to end her life.  ”I’m never going to find a man who loves me,” she wrote. ”I’m never going to be happy.” Give all of her things and money to the transgender civil rights movement and to transgender support groups, Leelah instructed.  ”The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren’t treated the way I was, they’re treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights. Gender needs to be taught about in schools, the earlier the better. My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. . .. Fix society. Please.” Two days after the teen’s death, grieving in that   way that only parents who have to bury a child understand, Carla Alcorn kept repeating that she loved her child.  ”He was an amazing musician and artist,” she said. ”He was an amazing boy.” More education, time and compassion, Not far from where the Alcorns live, Shane Morgan was thinking a lot about Leelah.  The executive director of the   advocacy group TransOhio said the teen’s suicide evoked memories of what it was like 15 years ago when he struggled with telling friends and family he was transgender.  ”I came out as gay. . .. I didn’t understand what gender identity was at that time,” he said.  As Morgan got older and met different people and had new experiences, he gained confidence and courage.  He wrote a letter to his family and friends, telling them he was transgender. With the exception of his father and brother, he said, everyone was loving. Morgan said he understands the anger some people feel toward Leelah’s parents, but ”there’s no excuse for threats to the family.” The transgender life: What to know, say and understand, Since Leelah’s death, parents of transgender children have sent TransOhio photos and letters saying how much the tragedy has shaken them and that they love and accept their children no matter what. Their greatest fear is that their child will feel unloved. And statistics show that that can lead to suicides like Leelah’s.  A 2011 study by the National Center for Transgender Equality found that 41% of 6, 450 responding transgender and gender nonconforming people had attempted suicide. If he could have talked to Leelah, Morgan would have said that he understood how tough it is and how awful it feels. He would have told her that when she got a little bit older, she would be freer to adopt another kind of family    one of friends who would accept and cherish her.  ”I wouldn’t have told her that it gets better, but it changes,” he said. ”There are people she could have met. I don’t know if she ever met a transgender person. But she could have seen something else. She could have been given some hope.” Aidan Key also knows well what it’s like to endure a transgender adolescence. The founder of the family education and support organization Gender Diversity in Washington grew up in a fundamentalist Christian household and now works with families with deep religious beliefs to help them understand what being transgender means.  He considers himself lucky to have a mother and twin sister who adored him regardless of his gender identity.  ”My compassion is there for the parents. All any parent wants is love for their children, for their children to live good lives. Transgender is such a new thing in society, and we’ve not faced it or discussed it as a society. We’ve kept it in a dark corner where some people still think it’s some deviant sexual behavior,” said Key.  ”If the parents would have reached out for more information or said ’This is a lot. We need some time,’ or if they had access to a group that would welcome them to talk, that might have made the difference for Leelah.” Opinion: What transgender teen’s death should show us
Italy’s coast guard averts migrant ship crash	2014-12-31	2014	12	Rome (CNN) It could have been, in the words of the Italian coast guard, a disaster. But thanks to authorities, a ship on course to crash against the rocky Italian coast was stopped in time, saving passengers and averting a possible environmental catastrophe. Italian coast guard commander Filippo Marini said the vessel was cruising on autopilot toward the coast at 6 nautical miles per hour. When it entered Italian search and rescue waters, the coast guard sent helicopters with six men, who boarded the ship and took control.  The course of the vessel was reversed to avoid a collision with the rocks, and it was piloted instead to Gallipoli, in Italy’s southern Puglia region. It docked safely there Wednesday. The freighter carried 796 migrants, the coast guard said Thursday, most believed to be from   Syria. Authorities on Wednesday put the number of migrants on board at 768.  The crew of the Blue Sky M apparently jumped ship. The coast guard said a collision would not only have led to the deaths of passengers, but would also have created an environmental disaster. It said a ”real disaster” was avoided. The freighter sent a distress signal near the Greek island of Corfu on Tuesday, alerting Italian and Greek authorities to the situation on board. The Greek Merchant Marine Ministry and the Greek Navy have said the pilot of a Greek helicopter that flew over the cargo ship spoke with the captain, who said the ship was not in distress and did not need assistance.  Floriana Segreto, a spokeswoman for the Italian coast guard in Rome, said there were no deaths related to the Blue Sky M incident. She added that about 100 people have been hospitalized, mainly because of the cold and exhaustion. It was not immediately clear where the migrants will go. The authorities will investigate what happened to the crew and how the freighter reached Italy’s waters.
Why Emotional Learning May Be As Important As The ABCs	2014-12-31	2014	12	Thomas O’Donnell’s kindergarten kids are all hopped up to read about Twiggle the anthropomorphic Turtle. ”Who can tell me why Twiggle here is sad,” O’Donnell asks his class at Matthew Henson Elementary School in Baltimore. ”Because he doesn’t have no friends,” a student pipes up. And how do people look when they’re sad? ”They look down!” the whole class screams out. Yeah, Twiggle is lonely. But, eventually, he befriends a hedgehog, a duck and a dog. And along the way, he learns how to play, help and share. These are crucial skills we all need to learn, even in preschool and kindergarten. And common sense  —   along with a growing body of research  —   shows that mastering social skills early on can help people stay out of trouble all the way into their adult lives. So shouldn’t schools teach kids about emotions and conflict negotiation in the same way they teach math and reading? The creators of Twiggle the Turtle say the answer is yes. Emotional Intelligence 101, Twiggle is part of a program called Promoting Alternative Thinking Strategies, or PATHS. It’s designed to help young kids recognize and express emotions. Matthew Henson Elementary is one of about 1, 500 schools around the country using this program, which was first developed in the 1980s. Every week, students get two   to   lessons on themes like   and treating others with respect. Especially for the youngest kids  —   in kindergarten and first grade  —   Twiggle often serves as their guide. O’Donnell says his students are really taking to the lessons. They’re trained, for example, to ”do the Turtle” when they’re upset. ”That’s when they stop and cocoon themselves. They wrap their arms around themselves and they say what the problem is,” he explains. O’Donnell’s kids do the turtle all the time  —   in the hallway and during class. Right before class starts, for example, one little girl tells her friend, ”I don’t like when you touch my hair, because it makes me sad.” ”Sorry!” her friend responds. While most kids will eventually figure out such strategies on their own, or with help from their parents, O’Donnell says, the lessons help them learn more quickly. And for some, especially those with troubled home lives, Twiggle is their first and only introduction to healthy   he says. ”Some of them don’t have words to express how they feel before this.” The Long Game, We previously reported on a national study comparing PATHS and other, similar programs showing positive effects in preschool. They are based on research showing that kids who act up a lot in school and at home  —   even very young kids  —   are more likely to have mental health problems and commit crimes years later as adults. So Kenneth Dodge, a psychologist at Duke University, asked, ”Could we do something about that to prevent those problems from actually occurring?” And he has dedicated his career to answering that question. He and his colleagues launched the FastTrack Project to see if they could change students’ life trajectory by teaching them what researchers like to call   intelligence. Back in 1991, they screened    at schools around the country for behavior problems. After interviewing teachers and parents, the researchers identified 900 children who seemed to be most at risk for developing problems later on. Half of these kids went through school as usual  —   though they had access to free counseling or tutoring. The rest got PATHS lessons, as well as counseling and tutoring, and their parents received training as well  —   all the way up until the students graduated from high school. By age 25, those who were enrolled in the special program not only had done better in school, but they also had lower rates of arrests and fewer mental health and substance abuse issues. The results of this   study were published in September in the American Journal of Psychiatry. The findings prove, Dodge says, ”In the same way that we can teach reading literacy, we can teach social and emotional literacy.” Cost Versus Benefit, PATHS and FastTrack aren’t the only programs of their kind. A   learning program called RULER, developed at Yale University, has shown promising results, as well. And every year, the   Collaborative for Academic, Social and Emotional Learning rates the top   emotional intelligence programs around the country. So what’s the catch? Why don’t all schools offer emotional intelligence lessons? Well, it’s expensive. The full, intensive FastTrack program costs around $50, 000 per student, over a   period. Schools can also pick and choose elements of the program. For example, the short PATHS lessons about Twiggle at Matthew Henson Elementary cost less  —   about $600 per classroom to start, plus an additional $100 a year to keep it running. It’s pricey, but it does cost less per child than juvenile detention or rehab programs later on, according to Dodge. As a society, we spend a lot on remedial services  —   programs like PATHS are preventive, he says. ”This is something that in the long run will save dollars.” At Clark   School in Cleveland,   Tommy DeJesus Jr. says he thinks it’s been worthwhile. DeJesus has been exposed to the PATHS curriculum since he was in kindergarten, and he says he continues to use the social skills he learned from good old Twiggle. The other day, for example, DeJesus says, he was quick to step in when he saw that a friend was being teased. ”They were making fun of his shoes and how he dressed. I said, ’Just because you have shoes and he doesn’t, that doesn’t give you the right to bully him,’ ” he says. And the cool thing was, they listened.
